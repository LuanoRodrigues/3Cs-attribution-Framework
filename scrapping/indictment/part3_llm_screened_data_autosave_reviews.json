As an example of the Department\u2019s commitment to public-private operational collaboration to disrupt such adversaries\u2019 malicious cyber activities, as set forth in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the Department acted concurrently with a Microsoft civil action to restrain 66 internet domains used by the same actors.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s seizure of 41 internet domains reflects the Justice Department\u2019s cyber strategy in action \u2013 using all tools to disrupt and deter malicious, state-sponsored cyber actors,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThe Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans\u2019 sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials. With the continued support of our private sector partners, we will be relentless in exposing Russian actors and cybercriminals and depriving them of the tools of their illicit trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seizure is part of a coordinated response with our private sector partners to dismantle the infrastructure that cyber espionage actors use to attack U.S. and international targets,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cWe thank all of our private-sector partners for their diligence in analyzing, publicizing, and combating the threat posed by these illicit state-coordinated actions in the Northern District of California, across the United States, and around the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis disruption exemplifies our ongoing efforts to expel Russian intelligence agents from the online infrastructure they have used to target individuals, businesses, and governments around the world,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWorking closely with private-sector partners such as Microsoft, the National Security Division uses the full reach of our authorities to confront the cyber-enabled threats of tomorrow from Russia and other adversaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking in close collaboration with public and private sector partners\u2014in this case through the execution of domain seizures \u2014 we remain in prime position to counter and defeat a broad range of cyber threats posed by adversaries,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cOur efforts to prevent the theft of information by state-sponsored criminal actors are relentless, and we will continue our work in this arena with partners who share our common goals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis case underscores the importance of the FBI\u2019s enduring partnerships with private sector companies, which allow for rapid information sharing and coordinated action. With these seizures, we\u2019ve disrupted a sophisticated cyber threat aimed at compromising sensitive government intelligence and stealing valuable information,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. \u201cToday\u2019s success highlights the power of collaboration in safeguarding the United States against state-sponsored cybercrime.\u201d</p><p>According to the partially unsealed affidavit filed in support of the government\u2019s seizure warrant, the seized domains were used by hackers belonging to, or criminal proxies working for, the \u201cCallisto Group,\u201d an operational unit within Center 18 of the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB), to commit violations of unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information from a department or agency of the United States, unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information from a protected computer, and causing damage to a protected computer. Callisto Group hackers used the seized domains in an ongoing and sophisticated spear-phishing campaign with the goal of gaining unauthorized access to, and steal valuable information from, the computers and email accounts of U.S. government and other victims.</p><p>In conjunction, Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=66424&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">announced</a> the filing of a civil action to seize 66 internet domains also used by Callisto Group actors. Microsoft Threat Intelligence tracks this group as \u201cStar Blizzard\u201d (formerly SEABORGIUM, also known as COLDRIVER). Between January 2023 and August 2024, Microsoft observed Star Blizzard target over 30 civil society entities and organizations \u2013 journalists, think tanks, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) \u2013 by deploying spear-phishing campaigns to exfiltrate sensitive information and interfere in their activities.</p><p>The government\u2019s affidavit alleges the Callisto Group actors targeted, among others, United States-based companies, former employees of the United States Intelligence Community, former and current Department of Defense and Department of State employees, United States military defense contractors, and staff at the Department of Energy.

Charles R. Breyer, Senior U.S. District Judge, sentenced him to 30 months of imprisonment.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint filed on Apr. 16, 2024, a United States Probation Officer (identified as \u201cVictim-1\u201d) began supervising Sims-White upon his release from federal custody in March 2021. \u00a0While Sims-White was under federal supervision, Victim-1 sought warrants on multiple occasions for Sims-White\u2019s arrest, alleging violations of his conditions of supervised release. \u00a0As described in the criminal complaint and other court documents, Sims-White was arrested multiple times while under federal supervision.</p><p>In February 2024, Sims-White appeared again for detention proceedings in federal court in San Francisco and was remanded to federal custody pursuant to a detention order. \u00a0In his plea agreement, Sims-White admitted that after the February 2024 court proceedings, he knowingly and repeatedly made threats to Victim-1. \u00a0Specifically, Sims-White repeatedly made threats to kill and sexually assault Victim-1, including in the presence of multiple other individuals. \u00a0Sims-White also admitted that, further to making the threats to Victim-1, he made additional statements of harm regarding other federal officials.</p><p>Following the filing of the criminal complaint, Sims-White was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 18, 2024 on one count of Threatening to Assault, Kidnap, or Murder a United States Official, United States Judge, Federal Law Enforcement Officer, or Other Official in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B).</p><p>Judge Breyer scheduled Sims-White\u2019s sentencing for Dec. 18, 2024. \u00a0Sims-White faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B). \u00a0However, any sentence will be imposed by the Court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p><p>This case is being prosecuted by the National Security &amp; Cyber and General Crimes Sections of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, and is the result of an investigation by the United States Marshals Service.<br/>\u00a0</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>OAKLAND \u2013 A federal grand jury issued a superseding indictment yesterday charging former correctional officer Darrell Wayne Smith with 15 counts of sexual abuse, including a civil rights violation, against five female victims who were inmates under his custody and control at Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin (FCI Dublin).</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Officer Daryl Smith engaged in appalling criminal acts when he sexually abused those in his care and custody,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThis superseding indictment is the latest product of the Department\u2019s ongoing work to seek justice for victims of sexual assault at FCI Dublin. We remain steadfast in our commitment to root out sexual assault within the BOP and hold to account those who so egregiously violate their duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFederal prison guards must treat prisoners humanely,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey. \u201cVictimizing inmates sexually and denying them basic civil rights must end. Today\u2019s superseding indictment demonstrates my office\u2019s commitment to uncover such misconduct and prosecute officers who allegedly perpetrate such abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s superseding indictment includes three new allegations of sexual assault by Smith, a Correctional Officer at FCI Dublin. The 15 charges against Smith allege he sexually abused multiple inmates over several years, including brazen and violent acts. The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General is committed to aggressively investigating allegations of abuse at FCI Dublin and across the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\u201d said Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendant's alleged actions are some of the most disturbing charges we\u2019ve seen for a former federal corrections officer,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. \u201cSexual abuse scars everyone who survives it but can be particularly traumatizing when it\u2019s perpetrated by someone in a position of trust or authority. The FBI is steadfast in our commitment to defending the civil rights of everyone and investigating anyone who allegedly violates this fundamental protection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese allegations of sexual abuse are deeply troubling,\u201d said FBI San Francisco Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing civil rights statutes and holding accountable those who abuse their positions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The initial federal indictment against Darrell Wayne Smith, 55, now residing in Florida, was filed April 13, 2023, and charged him with engaging in illegal sexual acts with three female inmates while he was employed at FCI Dublin as a correctional officer. The initial indictment charged 12 counts that alleged 12 acts occurring between May 2019 and May 2021 in which Smith engaged in separate sexual conduct with each of the three inmate victims.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment issued yesterday, which supplants the initial indictment, identifies two additional victims and charges 15 counts against Smith. It charges all 12 counts of sexual abuse that were charged in the initial indictment and adds two new counts of sexual abuse, each involving one of the two additional victims. Each additional victim is described as being an inmate at FCI Dublin who suffered abusive sexual conduct by Smith while under his custodial and disciplinary control. Smith\u2019s charged sexual conduct is now alleged to have begun as early as August 2016.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment also charges a third new count that alleges a federal civil rights violation by Smith. The civil rights violation arises from aggravated sexual abuse that Smith is alleged to have perpetrated against one of the female inmates.</p>\n<p>Each alleged victim is identified in the superseding indictment by initials only and is alleged to have been in official detention and under Smith\u2019s custodial, supervisory, and disciplinary authority at the time of the charged conduct. Each count in the superseding indictment corresponds with one encounter during which Smith allegedly engaged in unlawful sexual acts or contact with one of the victims, except for the newly charged civil rights violation which is based upon alleged aggravated sexual abuse also charged in another count.</p>\n<p>Smith is now charged with six counts of sexual abuse of a ward, seven counts of abusive sexual contact, one count of aggravated sexual abuse, and one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.</p>\n<p>The charges presented in the superseding indictment are merely allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s arraignment on the superseding indictment has not yet been set. However, Smith is currently set to begin jury trial on March 17, 2025, in front of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers for the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for each count of aggravated sexual abuse and deprivation of rights under color of law. Additionally, Smith faces a statutory maximum penalty of 15 years in prison for each count of sexual abuse of a ward and a maximum penalty of two years in prison for each count of abusive sexual contact. In addition, as part of any sentence the court will order a term of supervised release and may order a fine of up to $250,000 for each count, restitution and additional assessments. A federal district court judge will determine a sentence only after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Molly Priedeman and Andrew Paulson for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case, with the assistance of Kay Konopaske. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI and DOJ-OIG.</p></div>",

Ramsey and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp. The sentence was handed down by the Hon. Jacqueline Scott Corley, U.S. District Judge. U.S. Attorney Ramsey recorded a video statement commenting on today\u2019s sentence that is available here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o9EH157Ffk\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o9EH157Ffk\">https://youtu.be/3o9EH157Ffk</a></p>\n<p>\u201cThis sentence is a warning: violence against those who serve the public and their families will not be tolerated,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department will aggressively prosecute those who target public servants and their families with violence. In a democracy, people vote, argue, and debate to achieve the policy outcome they desire. But the promise of democracy is that people will not employ violence to affect that outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an additional statement, U.S. Attorney Ramsey said, \u201cDavid DePape, when he planned his attempted kidnapping, claimed he intended to punish the Speaker Emerita and teach Congress as a whole a lesson. He then violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi. Today\u2019s sentence is a stern reminder to those who pursue violence against public officials and institutions that significant punishment will follow. I want to thank the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police and the members of my prosecution team\u2014including Helen Gilbert, Laura Vartain and Maddie Wachs \u2014for bringing this matter to a swift and decisive conclusion. We hope that the conclusion of the federal case brings a measure of healing to Mr. Pelosi and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing of David DePape to a significant prison term sends a clear message that violence and intimidation have no place in our community nor our political discourse. DePape's attack, fueled by misguided ideology, underscores the dangers posed by extremist beliefs,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. \u201cThe FBI is committed to protecting all citizens and ensuring that our democracy remains strong and resilient against those who seek to harm it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial established that weeks before the attack, DePape, 44, of Richmond, California, targeted Nancy Pelosi, who was then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and collected personal information about her, including her home address. DePape kept the information in a computer file he labeled \u201cfavorite politicians.\u201d DePape intended to kidnap the then-Speaker, hold her hostage, and break her kneecaps.</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial demonstrated that on the night of the assault, DePape used public transportation to travel from the East Bay to San Francisco while carrying two backpacks that contained a hammer, sledgehammer, duct tape, rope, zip ties, and electronic items, among other items. After arriving at the Pelosi residence, DePape used the hammer to break the window of a glass door and enter the home. Then-Speaker Pelosi was not home and her husband, Paul Pelosi, was sleeping on the third floor of the home. DePape roamed the home until he found Mr. Pelosi in the third-floor bedroom.</p>\n<p>The trial evidence demonstrated that DePape woke Mr. Pelosi and, while standing three to four feet from him holding the hammer and restraints, made various threats including, \u201cI will take you out.\u201d Mr. Pelosi managed to walk to his bathroom and call 9-1-1, during which he carefully used language to alert the emergency operator to the situation without agitating DePape.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pelosi convinced defendant to go downstairs to the first floor and continued talking to DePape. When the police arrived, Mr. Pelosi opened the door and the police ordered DePape to drop the hammer he was holding. Instead, DePape struck Mr. Pelosi three times with full force, fracturing his skull. The responding officers immediately tackled Depape and took him into custody.</p>\n<p>On November 9, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted DePape, charging him with one count of assault upon an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the official while engaged in the performance of official duties or with intent retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, and one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties. A jury convicted DePape of both charges.</p>\n<p>The Honorable Jacqueline Corley sentenced DePape to the statutory maximums on each count, which were 30 years in prison for the assault charge and 20 years in prison for the attempted kidnapping charge, the two sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p>In addition to the prison term, Judge Corley ordered the defendant to serve five years of supervised release, to begin after the prison term and ordered that DePape will receive credit for the little over 18 months that he has been in custody since his crime.</p>\n<p>In sentencing DePape, Judge Corley stated that DePape may still be dangerous, that his use of violence was \u201cgratuitous,\u201d and that because he entered the home of a politician, future would-be leaders now must consider whether entering public service through politics is worth the risk. \u201cBecause of your actions,\u201d said Judge Corley, \u201cwe will never know what we lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>The National Security and Cyber Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California is prosecuting the case. FBI San Francisco, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the San Francisco Police Department are investigating the case.</p></div>",

    "snippet": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The Department of Justice joined the United Kingdom and international law enforcement partners in London today to announce the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most active ransomware groups in the world that has targeted over 2,000 victims, received more than $120 million in ransom payments, and made ransom demands totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.",
    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The Department of Justice joined the United Kingdom and international law enforcement partners in London today to announce the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most active ransomware groups in the world that has targeted over 2,000 victims, received more than $120 million in ransom payments, and made ransom demands totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>The U.K. National Crime Agency\u2019s (NCA) Cyber Division, working in cooperation with the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other international law enforcement partners disrupted LockBit\u2019s operations by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization\u2019s infrastructure and seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, LockBit associates have deployed these kinds of attacks again and again across the United States and around the world. Today, U.S. and U.K. law enforcement are taking away the keys to their criminal operation,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAnd we are going a step further \u2014 we have also obtained keys from the seized LockBit infrastructure to help victims decrypt their captured systems and regain access to their data. LockBit is not the first ransomware variant the Justice Department and its international partners have dismantled. It will not be the last.\u201d</p>\n<p>Additionally, the NCA, in cooperation with the FBI and international law enforcement partners, has developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Beginning today, victims targeted by this malware are encouraged to contact the FBI at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\" title=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/</a> to enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s actions are another down payment on our pledge to continue dismantling the ecosystem fueling cybercrime by prioritizing disruptions and placing victims first,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cUsing all our authorities and working alongside partners in the United Kingdom and around the world, we have now destroyed the online backbone of the LockBit group, one of the world\u2019s most prolific ransomware gangs. But our work does not stop here: together with our partners, we are turning the tables on LockBit \u2014 providing decryption keys, unlocking victim data, and pursuing LockBit\u2019s criminal affiliates around the globe.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Justice Department also unsealed an indictment obtained in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev, also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries. Additional criminal charges against Kondratyev were unsealed in the Northern District of California related to his deployment in 2020 of ransomware against a victim located in California.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Department also unsealed two search warrants issued in the District of New Jersey that authorized the FBI to disrupt multiple U.S.-based servers used by LockBit members in connection with the LockBit disruption. As disclosed by those search warrants, those servers were used by LockBit administrators to host the so-called \u201cStealBit\u201d platform, a criminal tool used by LockBit members to organize and transfer victim data.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, the FBI and our partners have successfully disrupted the LockBit criminal ecosystem, which represents one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u201cThrough years of innovative investigative work, the FBI and our partners have significantly degraded the capabilities of those hackers responsible for launching crippling ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure and other public and private organizations around the world. This operation demonstrates both our capability and commitment to defend our nation's cybersecurity and national security from any malicious actor who seeks to impact our way of life. We will continue to work with our domestic and international allies to identify, disrupt, and deter cyber threats, and to hold the perpetrators accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment obtained in the District of New Jersey, from at least as early as January 2021, Sungatov allegedly deployed LockBit ransomware against victim corporations and took steps to fund additional LockBit attacks against other victims. Sungatov allegedly deployed LockBit ransomware against manufacturing, logistics, insurance, and other companies located in Minnesota, Indiana, Puerto Rico, Wisconsin, Florida, and New Mexico. Additionally, as early as August 2021, Kondratyev similarly began to allegedly deploy LockBit against multiple victims. Kondratyev, operating under the online alias \u201cBassterlord,\u201d allegedly deployed LockBit against municipal and private targets in Oregon, Puerto Rico, and New York, as well as additional targets located in Singapore, Taiwan, and Lebanon. Both Sungatov and Kondratyev are alleged to have joined in the global LockBit conspiracy, also alleged to have included Russian nationals Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev and Mikhail Vasiliev, as well as other LockBit members, to develop and deploy LockBit ransomware and to extort payments from victim corporations.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment, unsealed as part of a global coordinated action against the most active ransomware group in the world, brings to five the total number of LockBit members charged by my office and our FBI and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section partners for their crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cAnd, even with today\u2019s disruption of LockBit, we will not stop there. Our investigation will continue, and we remain as determined as ever to identify and charge all of LockBit\u2019s membership \u2014 from its developers and administrators to its affiliates. We will put a spotlight on them as wanted criminals. They will no longer hide in the shadows.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the indictment unsealed today, a total of five LockBit members have now been charged for their participation in the LockBit conspiracy. In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging Matveev with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Matveev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at <a href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/home\" title=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/home\">https://tips.fbi.gov</a>. In November 2022, a criminal complaint was filed in the District of New Jersey charging Vasiliev in connection with his participation in the LockBit global ransomware campaign. Vasiliev, a dual Russian-Canadian national, is currently in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States. In June 2023, Russian national Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov was charged by criminal complaint in the District of New Jersey for his participation in the LockBit conspiracy, including his deployment of LockBit against victims in Florida, Japan, France, and Kenya. Astamirov is currently in custody in the United States awaiting trial.</p>\n<p>Kondratyev, according to the indictment obtained in the Northern District of California and unsealed today, is also charged with three criminal counts arising from his use of a ransomware variant to encrypt data, exfiltrate victim information, and extort a ransom payment from a corporate victim based in Alameda County, California.</p>\n<p>The LockBit ransomware variant first appeared around January 2020 and, leading into today\u2019s operation, had grown into one of the most active and destructive variants in the world. LockBit members have executed attacks against more than 2,000 victims in the United States and around the world, making at least hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in ransom demands and receiving over $120 million in ransom payments. The LockBit ransomware variant, like other major ransomware variants, operates in the \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d (RaaS) model, in which administrators, also called developers, design the ransomware, recruit other members \u2014 called affiliates \u2014 to deploy it, and maintain an online software dashboard called a \u201ccontrol panel\u201d to provide the affiliates with the tools necessary to deploy LockBit. Affiliates, in turn, identify and unlawfully access vulnerable computer systems, sometimes through their own hacking or at other times by purchasing stolen access credentials from others. Using the control panel operated by the developers, affiliates then deploy LockBit within the victim computer system, allowing them to encrypt and steal data for which a ransom is demanded to decrypt or avoid publication on a public website maintained by the LockBit developers, often called a data leak site.</p>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey and Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck, Debra Ireland, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the charges against Sungatov and Kondratyev unsealed today in the District of New Jersey. The Justice Department\u2019s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust and Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>The disruption announced today was the result of a joint operation between the FBI; NCA South West Regional Organised Crime Unit; France\u2019s Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command; Germany\u2019s Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein and the Bundeskriminalamt; Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Police, Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Canton of Zurich, and Zurich Cantonal Police; Japan\u2019s National Policy Agency; Australian Federal Police; Sweden\u2019s Polismyndighetens; Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Politie Dienst Regionale Recherche Oost-Brabant of the Netherlands; Finland\u2019s Poliisi; Europol; and Eurojust.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Helen L. Gilbert and the FBI Phoenix Field Office are investigating and prosecuting the case against Kondratyev in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced today that it is designating Sungatov and Kondratyev for their roles in launching cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, victims of LockBit should contact the FBI at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\" title=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov</a> for further information. Additional details on protecting networks against LockBit ransomware are available at StopRansomware.gov.

Klimenka also allegedly controlled Soft-FX, a technology services company, and FX Open, a financial company.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges BTC-e was a significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity. BTC-e allegedly facilitated transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received criminal proceeds from numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings, and allegedly was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking. BTC-e\u2019s servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme. Those servers were allegedly leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX.</p>\n<p>Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e allegedly was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate \u201cknow your customer\u201d or \u201cKYC\u201d verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law.</p>\n<p>Klimenka was arrested in Latvia on Dec. 21, 2023, at the request of the United States and made his initial appearance in San Francisco yesterday.

Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cWe are grateful to all of our partners for their assistance in addressing these threats posed by the FSB\u2019s action in the Northern District of California, across the United States and around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will not stand idly by as Russia continues to perpetuate this type of targeted malicious activity,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cRussian interference through malign foreign influence campaigns is deplorable, and we will not tolerate it in the United States or directed against our foreign partners. The FBI is dedicated to combating this pervasive threat and will tirelessly seek to prevent and disrupt these criminal acts carried out by Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCountering the persistent threat to critical infrastructure posed by state-sponsored Russian cybercriminals remains a top priority for the FBI,\u201d said FBI San Francisco Division Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. \u201cToday\u2019s charging announcement underscores the FBI\u2019s commitment to collaborate with our U.S. and international partners to disrupt these activities. We will identify those responsible and hold them accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment, which was unsealed today, alleges the conspiracy targeted current and former employees of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, Department of State, defense contractors, and Department of Energy facilities between at least October 2016 and October 2022. In addition, the indictment alleges the conspirators \u2013 known publicly by the name \u201cCallisto Group\u201d \u2013 targeted military and government officials, think tank researchers and staff, and journalists in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and that information from certain of these targeted accounts was leaked to the press in Russia and the United Kingdom in advance of U.K. elections in 2019.</p>\n<p>As a common example, the conspirators used \u201cspoofed\u201d email accounts designed to look like personal and work-related email accounts of the group\u2019s targets. The conspirators allegedly also sent sophisticated looking emails that appeared to be from email providers suggesting users had violated terms of service. These messages were designed to trick victims into providing their email account credentials to false login prompts. Once the conspirators fraudulently obtained the victim\u2019s credentials, they were able to use those credentials to access the victims\u2019 email accounts at will.</p>\n<p>In addition to the indictment, the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1962?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" title=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1962?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a> announced that it has sanctioned both Peretyatko and Korinets for their roles in malicious cyber-enabled activity.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 A federal jury convicted David DePape of assault and attempted kidnapping charges today in connection with his Oct. 28 intrusion into the home of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and her husband Paul Pelosi, announced United States Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp. The verdict follows a trial before the Hon. Jacqueline Scott Corley, U.S. District Judge.</p>\n<p>U.S. Attorney Ramsey stated, \u201cWe are grateful to the jury for their deliberations and the justice that this verdict signifies. Our public servants and their families deserve to work and live without threats and violence. Defendant\u2019s violent plan to kidnap then-Speaker Pelosi was rooted in his virulent disagreement with her as a result of her official position. His violent plan ended with the assault on Mr. Pelosi. Today\u2019s verdict brings justice to the Pelosi family and to the idea that violence has no place in politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe brutal and premeditated assault on Mr. Pelosi in the sanctity of his own home was fueled by DePape\u2019s misguided ideology. I am deeply gratified by the jury's verdict, which has ensured that DePape will face the full weight of justice,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Tripp. \"The unwavering collaboration between the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, and the United States Capitol Police played a pivotal role in securing this victory. We remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting our communities from those who seek to divide us through acts of violence and hatred.\u201d</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial established that weeks before the attack, DePape, 43, of Richmond, California, targeted Nancy Pelosi, who was then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and collected personal information about her, including her home address. DePape kept the information in a computer file he labeled \u201cfavorite politicians.\u201d DePape intended to kidnap the then-Speaker, hold her hostage, and break her kneecaps.</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial demonstrated that on the night of the assault, DePape used public transportation to travel from the East Bay to San Francisco while carrying two backpacks that contained a hammer, sledgehammer, duct tape, rope, zip ties, and electronic items, among other items. After arriving at the Pelosi residence, DePape used the hammer to break the window of a glass door and enter the home. Then-Speaker Pelosi was not home and her husband, Paul Pelosi, was sleeping on the third floor of the home. DePape roamed the home until he found Mr. Pelosi in the third-floor bedroom.</p>\n<p>The trial evidence demonstrated that DePape woke Mr. Pelosi and, while standing three to four feet from him holding the hammer and restraints, made various threats including, \u201cI will take you out.\u201d Mr. Pelosi managed to walk to his bathroom and call 9-1-1, during which he carefully used language to alert the emergency operator to the situation without agitating DePape.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pelosi convinced defendant to go downstairs to the first floor and continued talking to DePape. When the police arrived, Mr. Pelosi opened the door and the police ordered DePape to drop the hammer he was holding. Instead, DePape struck Mr. Pelosi three times with full force, fracturing his skull. The responding officers immediately tackled Depape and took him into custody.</p>\n<p>On November 9, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted DePape, charging him with one count of assault upon an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the official while engaged in the performance of official duties or with intent retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, and one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties. The jury convicted DePape of both charges.</p>\n<p>Judge Corley scheduled a status conference for December 13, 2022, at 10 a.m. The assault charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and the attempted kidnapping charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. However, any sentence will be imposed only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p>The National Security and Cyber Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California is prosecuting the case. FBI San Francisco, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the San Francisco Police Department are investigating the case.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The Department of Justice today unsealed charges related to the 2011 hack of the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and the operation of the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, both Russian nationals, are charged with laundering approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. Bilyuchenko is also charged with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis announcement marks an important milestone in two major cryptocurrency investigations. As alleged in the indictments, starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange\u2019s ultimate insolvency. Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese indictments highlight the department\u2019s unwavering commitment to bring to justice bad actors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and prevent the abuse of the financial system.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Southern District of New York Indictment</em></p>\n<p>According to court documents unsealed in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), in or about September 2011, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly gained unauthorized access to the server holding the cryptocurrency wallets for Mt. Gox. At the time, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in existence, servicing thousands of users worldwide. Mt. Gox stored the cryptocurrency wallets containing its customers\u2019 bitcoin, and the corresponding private keys used to authorize bitcoin transfers from those wallets, on a computer server in Japan.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs cyber criminals have become more sophisticated in their methods of thievery, our career prosecutors and law enforcement partners, too, have become experts in the latest technologies being abused for malicious purposes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAs alleged, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, a novel technology at the time, but the charges unsealed today demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals, no matter how complex their schemes, until they are brought to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly used their unauthorized access to Mt. Gox\u2019s server to fraudulently cause bitcoin to be transferred from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. From September 2011 through at least May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly caused the theft of at least approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox, representing the vast majority of the bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox\u2019s customers. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered the bulk of the bitcoins stolen through Mt. Gox principally through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators controlled at two other online bitcoin exchanges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will continue to work with our U.S. government and international partners to relentlessly pursue and disrupt malicious cyber actors wherever they may reside,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWhen cyber criminals engage in fraudulent activity, such as hacking and illicitly operating cryptocurrency exchanges, it is critical that we impose cost on the bad actors and ensure they face justice.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCryptocurrency offers a new way for criminals to steal and launder money, but greed and deceit are nothing new,\u201d said Chief Jim Lee of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). \u201cIRS-CI is specially equipped to follow the complex financial trail left by criminals, and we are dedicated to holding those accountable for crimes committed. IRS-CI is proud to stand with our law enforcement partners to announce this indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p>In furtherance of the money laundering scheme, in or about April 2012, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly negotiated and entered into a fraudulent contract (the \u201cAdvertising Contract\u201d) to provide purported advertising services to a Bitcoin brokerage service based in the Southern District of New York (the \u201cNew York Bitcoin Broker\u201d). Under the guise of the Advertising Contract, in order to conceal and liquidate the bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko and Verner allegedly made regular requests to the owner and operator of the New York Bitcoin Broker to make large wire transfers into various offshore bank accounts, including in the names of shell corporations, controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. In accordance with these requests, between in or about March 2012 and in or about April 2013, the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly transferred more than approximately $6.6 million to overseas bank accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. In exchange for the wire transfers, the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly received \u201ccredit\u201d on Exchange-1, through which Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered more than 300,000 of the bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. The fraudulent Advertising Contract with the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly enabled Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators to conceal and liquidate bitcoins stolen through the Mt. Gox Hack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mt. Gox ceased operations in 2014 after the theft was revealed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Northern District of California Indictment</em></p>\n<p>According to court documents unsealed in the Northern District of California (NDCA), Bilyuchenko allegedly worked with Vinnik and others to operate the BTC-e exchange from 2011 until it was shut down by law enforcement in July 2017. During that period, BTC-e was one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges and was one of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2013 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2013 to launder billions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cThe Department of Justice will work tirelessly to identify cyber criminals, no matter where they are. And Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will learn that the Department of Justice has long arms and an even longer memory for crimes that harm our communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBilyuchenko conspired with Vinnik and others to create a lawless and anonymous space in service to cybercriminals and cryptocurrency laundering,\u201d said Robert Tripp, SAC of the FBI San Francisco Field Office. \u201cFBI investigators were committed to shining a light on this activity through dogged investigation, technical skill, and partnerships. We will continue to work with our local and global law enforcement colleagues to identify, pursue, and arrest criminals no matter where they reside and no matter how long it takes.\u201d</p>\n<p>BTC-e served over one million users worldwide, moving millions of bitcoin worth of deposits and withdrawals, and processing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions. BTC-e received criminal proceeds of numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Secret Service has a long tradition of pursuing and bringing to justice those who aim to exploit our financial systems and target innocent victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge William Mancino of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cWorking together with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners, we will continue to investigate criminal organizations that operate in the ever-evolving cyber domain.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) continues to investigate cyber criminals illicitly operating in virtual spaces, and we are proud to have worked collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to bring these two individuals to justice,\u201d said Acting Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of HSI. \u201cOur special agents continue to investigate transnational criminal organizations operating in emerging technologies, leveraging our broad authorities to identify, and dismantle those behind sophisticated crypto-scams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHSI San Francisco/NorCal is on the alert to money laundering via crypto currency and other criminal activity that pervade the dark web,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Tatum King of HSI San Francisco. \u201cIn addition to the multi-year efforts of HSI personnel, partnerships continue to be key in this monumental and complex work and we are appreciative of joint efforts with FBI San Francisco, U.S. Secret Service San Francisco, IRS-CI San Francisco, and the Northern District U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, all of whom have expended significant resources in pursuit of this investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The SDNY indictment charges Bilyuchenko and Verner with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The NDCA indictment charges Bilyuchenko with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money services business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit is handling the SDNY case.

Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThis extradition demonstrates the Department\u2019s commitment to investigating and dismantling illicit cyber activity and would not have been possible without the relentless work of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs. The Justice Department thanks the Government of Greece, particularly the Ministry of Justice, for all their efforts in securing the defendant\u2019s transfer to the United States.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alexander Vinnik, 42, a Russian citizen, was charged in a 21-count superseding indictment in January 2017. Vinnik was taken into custody in Greece in July 2017 at the request of the United States. He made his initial appearance earlier today in federal court in San Francisco before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Vinnik and his co-conspirators allegedly owned, operated, and administrated BTC-e, a significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges BTC-e facilitated transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received criminal proceeds from numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings, and was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking, to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking. The investigation has revealed that BTC-e received more than $4 billion worth of bitcoin over the course of its operation.</p>\n<p>Despite doing substantial business in the United States, the indictment alleges that BTC-e was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate \u201cknow your customer\u201d or \u201cKYC\u201d verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In 2017, FinCEN assessed a civil money penalty against BTC-e for willfully violating U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) laws and against Vinnik for his role in the violations. A civil matter to enforce civil monetary penalties, in the amount of $88,596,314 as to BTC-e and $12 million as to Vinnik, is pending in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>The indictment charges BTC-e and Vinnik with one count of operation of an unlicensed money service business, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, the indictment charges Vinnik with 17 counts of money laundering and two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation (Oakland Field Office and Cyber Crime Unit, Washington, D.C.), Homeland Security Investigations, and U.S. Secret Service Criminal Investigative Division are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Quiroz of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the criminal case. The forefeiture action is being handled by David Countryman and related civil matters are being handled by Savith Iyengar.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team provided substantial assistance. The extradition request was handled by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department thanks the Greek Ministry of Justice for its cooperation in securing the defendant\u2019s transfer to the United States.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation.

In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace has received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>The seizure of the Hydra servers and cryptocurrency wallets was made this morning in Germany by the German Federal Criminal Police (the Bundeskriminalamt), in coordination with U.S. law enforcement. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who violate our laws \u2013 no matter where they are located or how they try to hide their crimes,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cTogether with our German law enforcement partners, we have seized the infrastructure of the world\u2019s largest darknet market, but our work is far from over. We will continue to work alongside our international and interagency partners to disrupt and dismantle darknet markets, and to hold those who commit their crimes on the dark web accountable for their acts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Department of Justice will not allow darknet markets and cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering and the sale of hacking tools and services,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cOur message should be clear: we will continue to go after darknet markets and those who exploit them. Together with our partners in Germany and around the world, we will continue our work to disrupt the ecosystem that allows these criminal actors to operate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis coordinated action sends a clear message to anyone attempting to operate or support an online criminal enterprise under the cover of the dark web. \u00a0The dark web is not a place criminals can operate with impunity or hide from U.S. law enforcement, and we will continue to use our sophisticated tools and expertise to dismantle and disable darknet markets,\u201d said Stephanie M. Hinds, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. \u00a0\u201cThis action also underscores the importance of international law enforcement collaboration. \u00a0We thank German authorities and the Bundeskriminalamt, the German Federal Criminal Police Office, for its valued assistance in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hydra was an online criminal marketplace that enabled users in mainly Russian-speaking countries to buy and sell illicit goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering and mixing services, anonymously and outside the reach of law enforcement. Transactions on Hydra were conducted in cryptocurrency and Hydra\u2019s operators charged a commission for every transaction conducted on Hydra.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the shutdown of Hydra, the department also announced criminal charges against Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, 30, a resident of Russia, for conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his operation and administration of the servers used to run Hydra.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe darknet has been a key online marketplace for the sale of deadly drugs worldwide,\u201d said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). \u201cThe availability of illicit substances and money laundering services offered by Hydra threaten the safety and health of communities far and wide. Criminals on the darknet hide behind the illusion of anonymity, but DEA and our partners across the globe are watching. We will continue to investigate, expose, and take action against criminal networks no matter where they operate. I commend the extraordinary investigative efforts of DEA\u2019s Miami Counternarcotic Cyber Investigations Task Force, Cyber Support Section, and Special Operations Division, and the teamwork from federal and international law enforcement partners that led to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hydra darknet site provided a platform for criminals who thought they were beyond the reaches of law enforcement to buy and sell illegal drugs and services,\u201d said Chief Jim Lee of IRS-Criminal Investigation. \u201cOur Cyber Crimes Unit once again used their cryptocurrency tracking expertise to help take down this site and identify the criminal behind it. Denying criminals a space to operate freely to conduct their nefarious activities is the first step in stopping this activity from happening altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe successful seizure of Hydra, the world's largest darknet marketplace, dismantled digital infrastructures enabling a wide range of criminals \u2013 including Russian cyber criminals, the cryptocurrency tumblers and money launderers that support them and others, and drug traffickers\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to the strength and potency of our law enforcement partnerships here and around the world \u2013 and another example of our strategy to broadly target the entire illicit ecosystem that drives and enables crime.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service is dedicated to protecting the United States mail from being used to transport illegal drugs and illicit goods available on the darknet,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service National Headquarters. \u201cThe seizure of the criminal marketplace, Hydra Market, reflects the effective collaboration of law enforcement to stop criminal enterprises from their illicit activity. The Postal Inspection Service will continue to work with our federal partners to end these criminal organizations regardless of where they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web\u2019s largest supplier of illicit goods and services, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate with impunity,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami. \u201cHSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law enforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to manipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all-over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, vendors on Hydra could create accounts on the site to advertise their illegal products, and buyers could create accounts to view and purchase the vendors\u2019 products. Hydra vendors offered a variety of illicit drugs for sale, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, LSD, and other opioids. The vendors openly advertised their drugs on Hydra, typically including photographs and a description of the controlled substance. Buyers rated the sellers and their products on a five-star rating system, and the vendors\u2019 ratings and reviews were prominently displayed on the Hydra site. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Hydra also featured numerous vendors selling false identification documents. Users could search for vendors selling their desired type of identification document \u2013 for example, U.S. passports or drivers\u2019 licenses \u2013 and filter or sort by the item\u2019s price. Many vendors of false identification documents offered to customize the documents based on photographs or other information provided by the buyers.</p>\n<p>Numerous vendors also sold hacking tools and hacking services through Hydra. Hacking vendors commonly offered to illegally access online accounts of the buyer\u2019s choosing. In this way, buyers could select their victims and hire professional hackers to gain access to the victims\u2019 communications and take over the victims\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p>Hydra vendors also offered a robust array of money laundering and so-called \u201ccash-out\u201d services, which allowed Hydra users to convert their bitcoin (BTC) into a variety of forms of currency supported by Hydra\u2019s wide array of vendors. In addition, Hydra offered an in-house mixing service to launder and then process vendors\u2019 withdrawals. Mixing services allowed customers, for a fee, to send bitcoin to designated recipients in a manner that was designed to conceal the source or owner of the bitcoin. Hydra\u2019s money laundering features were so in-demand that some users would set up shell vendor accounts for the express purpose of running money through Hydra\u2019s bitcoin wallets as a laundering technique.</p>\n<p>Starting in or about November 2015, Pavlov is alleged to have operated a company, Promservice Ltd., also known as All Wheel Drive and 4x4host.ru, that administered Hydra\u2019s servers (Promservice). During that time, Pavlov, through his company Promservice, administered Hydra\u2019s servers, which allowed the market to operate as a platform used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute large quantities of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to thousands of buyers, and to launder billions of dollars derived from these unlawful transactions. \u00a0</p>\n<p>As an active administrator in hosting Hydra\u2019s servers, Pavlov allegedly conspired with the other operators of Hydra to further the site\u2019s success by providing the critical infrastructure that allowed Hydra to operate and thrive in a competitive darknet market environment. In doing so, Pavlov is alleged to have facilitated Hydra\u2019s activities and allowed Hydra to reap commissions worth millions of dollars generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.</p>\n<p>The DEA\u2019s Miami Field Division, FBI, IRS-CI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and HSI investigated the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. investigation was conducted with support and coordination provided by the Department of Justice\u2019s multi-agency Special Operations Division and the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) Team.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claudia A. Quiroz and Robert S. Leach of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and Trial Attorneys C. Alden Pelker and Christen M. Gallagher of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>This prosecution is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) investigation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations that threaten the United States by using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks.</p>\n<p>In addition to the critically important efforts of the German Federal Criminal Police, significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia. Assistance was also provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Hinds and FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair. \u00a0The 2016 hack implicated approximately 57 million user and driver records\u2014Sullivan already was charged with obstruction of justice and misprision of a felony in connection with the alleged attempted cover-up of the incident. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sullivan, 52, of Palo Alto, Calif., was serving as Uber\u2019s Chief Security Officer when hackers revealed to him that they had accessed and downloaded an Uber database containing personally identifying information, or PII, including approximately 600,000 driver\u2019s license numbers associated with certain Uber drivers. \u00a0The superseding indictment describes how Sullivan allegedly orchestrated the disbursement of a six-figure payment to two hackers in exchange for their silence about the hack. \u00a0The superseding indictment further alleges that Sullivan took deliberate steps to prevent persons whose PII was stolen from discovering that the hack had occurred and took steps to conceal, deflect, and mislead the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the data breach.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstitutions that store personal information of others must comply with the law,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Hinds. \u201cWhen hacks like this occur, state law requires notice to victims. \u00a0Federal law also requires truthful answers to official government inquiries. \u00a0The indictment alleges that Sullivan failed to do either. \u00a0We allege Sullivan falsified documents to avoid the obligation to notify victims and hid the severity of a serious data breach from the FTC, all to enrich his company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Mr. Sullivan had immediately reported the breach\u2014instead of misleading the government by withholding information\u2014the FBI could have been better able to assist Uber; also, the data breach of at least one additional large tech company may have been prevented,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Fair. \u00a0\u201cThis case should serve as an example to corporations and company executives that working with the FBI is crucial when dealing with the aftermath of a breach; such communication is a best practice in preventing the loss of data and private information.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The newly filed allegations of wire fraud center around Sullivan\u2019s attempt to defraud Uber\u2019s drivers by failing to disclose the 2016 breach. \u00a0Specifically, the superseding indictment describes how California law, under certain circumstances, requires businesses operating in the state to notify residents whose information may have been stolen in such data breaches. \u00a0The superseding indictment further alleges that, rather than notify the drivers of the breach, Sullivan took deliberate steps to ensure Uber\u2019s drivers and others did not learn the true nature of the incident. \u00a0Among the steps taken by Sullivan to suppress discovery of the breach was his plan to have two of the hackers execute non-disclosure agreements. \u00a0The non-disclosure agreements falsely stated the hackers had neither taken nor stored Uber\u2019s data in the 2016 breach. In addition, Sullivan allegedly misrepresented to Uber\u2019s new chief executive officer the nature and scope of the data that was compromised; falsely suggested to the new CEO that the incident was not a data breach; and sent an email falsely claiming that the data breach was not, in fact, a data breach at all, but rather an incident that was no more severe than other security incidents. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment also incorporates the obstruction of justice and misprision of a felony charges described in previously filed documents. \u00a0Documents filed earlier in the case provide background for the charges. \u00a0For example, the documents describe how Sullivan played a pivotal role in responding to FTC inquiries about Uber\u2019s cyber security. \u00a0Specifically, Uber had been hacked in September of 2014 and the FTC was gathering information about that 2014 breach. \u00a0After the FTC demanded responses to written questions and required Uber to designate an officer to provide testimony under oath on a variety of topics, Sullivan assisted in the preparation of Uber\u2019s responses to the written questions and was designated to provide sworn testimony on a variety of issues. \u00a0On November 14, 2016, approximately 10 days after providing his testimony to the FTC, Sullivan received an email from a hacker informing him that Uber had been breached again. Sullivan\u2019s team was able to confirm the breach within 24 hours of his receipt of the email.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rather than report the 2016 breach, Sullivan allegedly took deliberate steps to prevent knowledge of the breach from reaching the FTC. \u00a0For example, as described above, Sullivan arranged to pay off the hackers in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements that contained the false representation that the hackers did not take or store any data. \u00a0In addition, Sullivan sought to pay the hackers off by funneling the payoff through a bug bounty program\u2014a program in which a third-party intermediary arranges payment to so-called \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers who point out security issues but have not actually compromised data. \u00a0In addition, Uber paid the hackers $100,000 in BitCoin in December 2016, despite the fact that the hackers refused to provide their true names. \u00a0Uber was ultimately able to identify the two hackers in January 2017 and required them to execute new copies of the non-disclosure agreements in their true names. \u00a0The two hackers identified by Uber were ultimately prosecuted in the Northern District of California. \u00a0Both pleaded guilty on October 30, 2019, to computer fraud conspiracy charges and now await sentencing. \u00a0The separate guilty pleas entered by the hackers demonstrate that after Sullivan assisted in covering up the nature of the hack of Uber, the hackers were able to commit an additional intrusion at another corporate entity\u2014Lynda.com\u2014and attempt to ransom that data as well. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Sullivan is charged with three counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505; and misprision of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. \u00a0If convicted, he faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, five years in prison for the obstruction charge, and a maximum three years in prison for the misprision charge. \u00a0However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Sullivan\u2019s arraignment on the new charges has not yet been scheduled. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Uber\u2019s new management ultimately discovered the truth about the breach and disclosed the breach publicly, and to the FTC, in November 2017. \u00a0Since that time, Uber has responded to additional government inquiries. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The case is being prosecuted by the Corporate and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. \u00a0The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI. \u00a0\u00a0</p></div>",

Hinds; Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas McQuaid of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; and Kelly R. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A criminal complaint filed March 4, 2019, charged Karlsson, 47, and his company, Eastern Metal Securities (EMS), with crimes involving a scheme to defraud victims of more than $16 million.\u00a0 Karlsson, also known by several aliases including Steve Heyden, Euclid Deodoris, Joshua Millard, Lars Georgsson, Paramon Larasoft, and Kenth Westerberg, was arrested on June 17, 2019, in Thailand and was extradited to the United States to face the charges.\u00a0 A federal grand jury indicted Karlsson and EMS on July 25, 2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe internet has pioneered extraordinary opportunities for commerce,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Hinds. \u201cUnfortunately, the same tools that have provided innovative methods of doing business also have provided fertile grounds for fraudsters to take advantage of the unwary.\u00a0 This case demonstrates that we will pursue fraudsters who seek to find their victims in the Northern District of California, even if such criminals operate from outside the country.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKarlsson\u2019s false promises of a profitable investment with minimal risk bilked tens of millions of dollars from his unsuspecting victims,\u201d said IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jackson. \u201cKarlsson\u2019s admission today will hopefully provide some measure of justice for more the more than 3,500 victims he scammed and put them on a path to financial restoration.\u00a0 We were glad to provide our expertise in tracing virtual currency in this investigation, diminishing the belief of anonymity associated with these transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment and a factual basis filed by the government describe a long-running scheme by which Karlsson and EMS used a website to commit wire fraud against thousands of victims.\u00a0 Specifically, the indictment explains that from November 27, 2012, through June 19, 2019, Karlsson and EMS used <a href=\"http://www.easternmetalsecurities.com\">www.easternmetalsecurities.com</a> to make fraudulent representations and convince victims to send funds using a virtual currency exchange.\u00a0 During the same period, Karlsson and EMS used deceptive \u201cdevices and contrivances\u201d to sell securities and then tried to conceal the proceeds of the wire fraud and securities fraud.\u00a0 In sum, the indictment charges Karlsson and EMS with one count each of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5; and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957.\u00a0 Karlsson pleaded guilty to all the charges pending against him.\u00a0 EMS has ceased to exist.</p>\n<p>During the hearing, Karlsson admitted that he used the website to invite potential investors to purchase shares of the plan for less than $100 per share, promising an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share, an amount of gold which as of Jan. 2, 2019, was worth more than $45,000.\u00a0 Karlsson advised investors that, in the unlikely event that the gold payout did not happen, he guaranteed to them 97% of the amount they invested. Karlsson admitted he had no way to pay off the investors.\u00a0 Instead, the funds provided by victims were transferred to Karlsson\u2019s personal bank accounts and he then used proceeds to purchase expensive homes and a resort in Thailand.</p>\n<p>As the government has alleged, Karlsson also used a second website, <a href=\"http://www.hci25.com\">www.hci25.com</a>, to make multiple false communications to potential investors.\u00a0 Karlsson brought the investors in HCI25 together with the investors in the \u201cPre Funded Reversed Pension Plan\u201d and posted multiple communications to delay the moment investors would realize there would be no payout.\u00a0 For example, on one occasion, Karlsson explained that a payout had not occurred because releasing so much money all at once could cause a negative effect on financial systems throughout the world.\u00a0 Karlsson also falsely represented that EMS was working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare the way for a payout.</p>\n<p>Karlsson directed his victims to make investments using virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin.\u00a0 Karlsson admitted he defrauded no less than 3,575 victims of more than $16 million.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Karlsson faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine for the wire fraud and securities fraud charges, and 20 years in prison and a $500,000 maximum fine for the money laundering charge.\u00a0 In addition, the court also may order an additional term of supervised release, fines or other assessments, and restitution, if appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Frentzen and Trial Attorney Catherine Alden Pelker of the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting this case.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Beausey of the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is prosecuting the forfeiture proceedings.\u00a0 This prosecution is the result of an investigation by the IRS-CI Washington, D.C. Cyber Crimes Unit. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 Office in Thailand, the IRS Criminal Investigation Attach\u00e9 Office in Hong Kong and the Royal Thai Police Crime Suppression Division provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

Anderson and U.S. Secret Service Criminal Investigative Division Special Agent in Charge David Smith.\u00a0 In addition, the United States Attorney filed documents seeking the civil and criminal forfeiture of assets traceable to the alleged crimes.\u00a0 Further information about the announcement can be found here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RGAIsqmixdg\">https://youtu.be/RGAIsqmixdg</a>.</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment, filed February 18, 2020, was unsealed earlier today.\u00a0 According to the Superseding Indictment, Potekhin, of Voronezh, Russia, created numerous web domains that mimicked those of legitimate virtual currency exchanges.\u00a0 This tactic used a combination of \u201cphishing\u201d and \u201cspoofing\u201d to exploit Internet users\u2019 trust in known companies and organizations to fraudulently obtain their login credentials, including email addresses, password information, and other personal information.\u00a0 When unwitting customers accessed the fraudulent websites and entered their login information, Potekhin and his co-conspirators stole the victims\u2019 credentials and gained access to their cryptocurrency accounts, from which they stole funds or which they used to manipulate cryptocurrency markets for their own gain.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy warning to internet fraudsters is that we will prosecute internet frauds against U.S. citizens regardless of where those frauds originate,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cMy warning to the public is that digital currency exchanges are not like banks.\u00a0 The security of digital currency exchanges is only as good as your own vigilance.\u00a0 While law enforcement will do everything within our power to protect you, you must also protect yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince its inception in 1865 to combat U.S. currency counterfeiting, the Secret Service has remained committed to safeguarding the Nation\u2019s financial infrastructure,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Smith. \u201cThe Secret Service mission has evolved to combat cyber fraud by tracing and seizing fraudulently obtained virtual currencies. These recent actions highlight the efforts of law enforcement to provide attribution to cybercriminals wherever they may reside.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment describes similar attacks perpetrated against the customers of three cryptocurrency platforms, two of which are based in the United States, and one based abroad.\u00a0 Victims of the attacks are alleged to have included people residing in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment describes a number of complex fraud schemes used by the defendants and their co-conspirators to maximize the value of the cryptocurrency that they stole from the customers of these digital currency exchanges.\u00a0 The first fraud scheme, referred to as a theft attack in the Superseding Indictment, was a scheme to steal digital currency from as many users of a U.S.-based digital currency exchange as possible in a short amount of time.\u00a0 Beginning in July 2017, Potekhin created and controlled at least 13 separate fake domains for this digital currency exchange.\u00a0 Using the fake domains, the defendants induced more than 150 victim customers of the exchange to input their user identification and passwords.\u00a0 Potekhin and Karasavidi, of Moscow, also created multiple fictitious accounts with the same digital currency exchange, and used stolen information from at least three individuals from the United Kingdom to create three of those accounts.\u00a0 The defendants then used the stolen credentials from the victim customers to access the victims\u2019 accounts in August 2017 and withdraw digital currency without authorization.\u00a0 By linking the fictitious accounts to the accounts of victim customers, the defendants were able to withdraw larger sums of digital currency from victim accounts without authorization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment further describes a sophisticated market manipulation scheme that began in July 2017 using the stolen customer credentials of the same U.S.-based digital currency exchange and culminated in a manipulation attack that targeted three victim customers.\u00a0 The defendants first created a number of fictitious accounts on the same platform and each account purchased an inexpensive digital currency known as GAS prior to the manipulation.\u00a0 Then, on October 29, 2017, the defendants took control of the three victim customer accounts and used the digital currency contained in those accounts, with a value of over $5 million at that time, to purchased GAS at the same time, which increased demand and price.\u00a0 The defendants and their co-conspirators then quickly converted the digital currency in their fictitious accounts from GAS to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, causing the value of GAS to plummet and leaving the value of GAS that remained in the victim customer accounts worthless, causing a loss to these three victims of approximately $5 million.</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment also alleges similar fraud schemes that took place between October 2017 and March 2018, and which resulted in theft attacks targeting victim customers of another U.S.-based digital currency exchange and one based abroad.\u00a0 The value of the stolen digital currency at the time of the thefts was over $11 million.</p>\n<p>The Superseding Indictment alleges the defendants laundered the proceeds of the attacks and attempted to conceal the nature and source of the digital currency by transferring them in a layered and sophisticated manner through multiple accounts.\u00a0 Ultimately, a significant amount of the stolen digital currency was deposited into Karasavidi\u2019s account.</p>\n<p>In sum, Potekhin and Karasavidi have been charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(b); computer fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(4); conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349; money laundering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h); and two counts of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(1).</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The defendants remain at large.\u00a0 If convicted, the defendants face the following maximum statutory penalties:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p><b>Charge</b></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><b>Statute</b></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><b>Maximum Penalties</b></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Conspiracy to Commit Computer Fraud and Abuse</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01030(b)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>(1) 10 years\u2019 imprisonment;

Anderson; Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; and Kelly R. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office. \u00a0</p>\n<p>On July 25, 2019, a federal grand jury indicted Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 45, and his company, Eastern Metal Securities (EMS), charging the defendants with engaging in a scheme to defraud victims of more than $11 million. \u00a0Karlsson was arrested June 17, 2019, in Thailand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to a complaint filed March 4, 2019, in connection with the case, Karlsson, also known by several aliases including Steve Heyden, Euclid Deodoris, Joshua Millard, Lars Georgsson, Paramon Larasoft, and Kenth Westerberg, used websites to communicate false representations to victims in a scheme to defraud potential investors. \u00a0For example, one website, www.easternmetalsecurities.com, allegedly was registered to a fictitious person and advertised shares in a product called a \u201cPre Funded Reversed Pension Plan\u201d (PFRPP). \u00a0The complaint alleges Karlsson used the website to invite potential investors to purchase shares of the plan for $98 per share in exchange for an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share, even though as of January 2, 2019, 1.15 kilograms of gold was worth more than $45,000. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Karlsson also allegedly advised investors that, in the unlikely event that the gold payout did not happen, he guaranteed to them 97% of the amount they invested. According to the complaint, the government found no evidence of any accounts held by Karlsson that would allow him to pay off the investors. \u00a0Instead, the complaint alleges, the funds provided by victims were transferred to Karlsson\u2019s personal bank accounts and now appear to be tied up in real estate in Thailand.</p>\n<p>The complaint further describes how Karlsson allegedly used a second website, www.hci25.com, to make multiple false communications to potential investors. \u00a0Karlsson allegedly brought the investors in HCI25 together with the investors in the PFRPP and posted multiple communications to delay the moment investors would realize there would be no payout. \u00a0For example, on one occasion, Karlsson allegedly explained that a payout had not occurred because releasing so much money all at once could cause a negative effect on financial systems throughout the world. \u00a0Karlsson also falsely represented that EMS was working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare the way for a payout.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges Karlsson directed his victims to make investments using virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. \u00a0Karlsson allegedly defrauded no less than 3,575 victims of more than $11 million. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment charges Karlsson with wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5; and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. \u00a0Karlsson was arrested June 17, 2019, in Thailand and arrived in the United States today to face the charges. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment and a criminal complaint merely allege that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Karlsson made his initial federal court appearance this morning before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim. \u00a0Magistrate Judge Kim ordered Karlsson detained and pending a further detention hearing scheduled for Friday, November 22, 2019.</p>\n<p>If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine for the wire fraud and securities fraud charges, and 20 years in prison and a $500,000 maximum fine for the money laundering charge. \u00a0In addition, the court also may order an additional term of supervised release, fines or other assessments, and restitution, if appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Frentzen and Trial Attorney Catherine Alden Pelker of the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting this case. \u00a0This prosecution is the result of an investigation by the IRS-CI Washington, D.C. Cyber Crimes Unit. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 Office in Thailand, the IRS Criminal Investigation Attach\u00e9 Office in Hong Kong and the Royal Thai Police Crime Suppression Division provided significant assistance.<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Anderson and United States Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Thomas C. Edwards. \u00a0The Honorable Jon S. Tigar, U.S. District Judge, handed down the sentence earlier today.</p>\n<p>Mitchell, 45, of Antioch, pleaded guilty to the charge on August 16, 2019. \u00a0According to his plea agreement, Mitchell admitted to possessing and distributing to others images of children as young as seven years old engaged in sexually explicit conduct. \u00a0Mitchell used a social media platform to communicate with others and then distribute the images, which included videos and GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format). \u00a0In one video, an adult male voice is heard giving directions to two minors who were engaged in sexually explicit conduct. \u00a0Mitchell also agreed he was subject to a minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment because of his conviction in 1999 for unlawful sex with a minor.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Mitchell on May 9, 2019, charging him with two counts of distribution of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1), and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2). Mitchell pleaded guilty to the possession count and the distribution counts were dismissed at sentencing. \u00a0</p>\n<p>This investigation began when a member of the public called local police to report Mitchell\u2019s transmission of child pornography using a social media platform. \u00a0In addition, during the course of the investigation, Mitchell was identified as the user of a social media account that had been reported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) as being used to transmit child pornography. \u00a0NCMEC had received a cyber-tip indicating that an individual was using a social media platform to send child pornography to other users. \u00a0Law enforcement eventually identified Mitchell as the user of the account transmitting the images. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition to the prison term, Judge Tigar sentenced Mitchell to seven years of supervised release. \u00a0The defendant will begin serving the prison term immediately. \u00a0In addition, Judge Tigar scheduled a hearing for January 24, 2020, to determine issues regarding restitution.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan U.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p><strong>Note</strong>: A copy of the superseding criminal complaint can be found <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/1381806/dl\">here</a>.</p><p>A superseding criminal complaint filed in the District of New Jersey was unsealed today charging a dual Russian and Israeli national for being a developer of the LockBit ransomware group.</p><p>In August, Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, was arrested in Israel pursuant to a U.S. provisional arrest request with a view towards extradition to the United States. Panev is currently in custody in Israel pending extradition on the charges in the superseding complaint.</p><p>\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s work going after the world\u2019s most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks, but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThree of the individuals who we allege are responsible for LockBit\u2019s cyberattacks against thousands of victims are now in custody, and we will continue to work alongside our partners to hold accountable all those who lead and enable ransomware attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department's commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cWe started this year with a coordinated international disruption of LockBit \u2014 the most damaging ransomware group in the world. Fast forward to today and three LockBit actors are in custody thanks to the diligence of our investigators and our strong partnerships around the world. This case is a model for ransomware investigations in the years to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arrest of alleged developer Rostislav Panev is part of the FBI\u2019s ongoing efforts to disrupt and dismantle the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe LockBit group has targeted both public and private sector victims around the world, including schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, as well as small businesses and multi-national corporations. \u00a0No matter how hidden or advanced the threat, the FBI remains committed to working with our interagency partners to safeguard the cyber ecosystem and hold accountable those who are responsible for these criminal activities.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe criminal complaint alleges that Rostislav Panev developed malware and maintained the infrastructure for LockBit, which was once the world\u2019s most destructive ransomware group and attacked thousands of victims, causing billions of dollars in damage,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cAlong with our domestic and international law enforcement\u00a0partner actions to dismantle LockBit\u2019s infrastructure, the Criminal Division has disrupted LockBit\u2019s operations by charging\u00a0seven of its key members (including affiliates, developers, and its administrator) and arresting three of these defendants \u2014 including Panev. We are especially grateful for our partnerships with authorities in Europol, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, which show that, when likeminded countries work together, cybercriminals will find it harder to escape justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs alleged by the complaint, Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit coconspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cBut just like the six other LockBit members previously identified and charged by this office and our FBI and Criminal Division partners, Panev could not remain anonymous and avoid justice indefinitely. He must now answer for his crimes. Today\u2019s announcement represents another blow struck by the United States and our international partners against the LockBit organization, and our efforts will continue relentlessly until the group is fully dismantled and its members brought to justice.\u201d</p><p>According to the superseding complaint, documents filed in this and related cases, and statements made in court, Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. During that time, Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States. Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit\u2019s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery.</p><p>LockBit\u2019s members comprised \u201cdevelopers,\u201d like Panev, who designed the LockBit malware code and maintained the infrastructure on which LockBit operated. LockBit\u2019s other members, called \u201caffiliates,\u201d carried out LockBit attacks and extorted ransom payments from LockBit victims. LockBit\u2019s developers and affiliates would then split ransom payments extorted from victims.</p><p>As alleged in the superseding complaint, at the time of Panev\u2019s arrest in Israel in August, law enforcement discovered on Panev\u2019s computer administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and stored source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which allowed LockBit\u2019s affiliates to generate custom builds of the LockBit ransomware malware for particular victims. On that repository, law enforcement also discovered source code for LockBit\u2019s StealBit tool, which helped LockBit affiliates exfiltrate data stolen through LockBit attacks. Law enforcement also discovered access credentials for the LockBit control panel, an online dashboard maintained by LockBit developers for LockBit\u2019s affiliates and hosted by those developers on the dark web.</p><p>The superseding complaint also alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit\u2019s primary administrator, who, in an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware\">indictment</a> unsealed in the District of New Jersey in May, the United States alleged to be Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432), also known as LockBitSupp, LockBit, and putinkrab. In those messages, Panev and the LockBit primary administrator discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel.</p><p>Court documents further indicate that, between June 2022 and February 2024, the primary LockBit administrator made a series of transfers of cryptocurrency, laundered through one or more illicit cryptocurrency mixing services, of approximately $10,000 per month to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev. Those transfers amounted to over $230,000 during that period.</p><p>In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work, consistent with the transfers identified by U.S. authorities. Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network. Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group.</p><p><u>The LockBit Investigation</u></p><p>The superseding complaint against, and apprehension of, Panev follows a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">disruption</a>\u00a0of LockBit ransomware in February by the United Kingdom (U.K.)\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA)\u2019s Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization\u2019s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. That disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit\u2019s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by documents filed in this case.</p><p>The superseding complaint against Panev also follows charges brought in the District of New Jersey against other LockBit members, including its alleged primary creator, developer, and administrator, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. An\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware\">indictment</a> against Khoroshev unsealed in May alleges that Khoroshev began developing LockBit as early as September 2019, continued acting as the group\u2019s administrator through 2024, a role in which Khoroshev recruited new affiliate members, spoke for the group publicly under the alias \u201cLockBitSupp,\u201d and developed and maintained the infrastructure used by affiliates to deploy LockBit attacks. Khoroshev is currently the subject of a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/transnational-organized-crime-rewards-program-2/lockbit-ransomware-administrator-dmitry-yuryevich-khoroshev/\">reward of up to $10 million</a> through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tips.fbi.gov/\">www.tips.fbi.gov/</a>.</p><p>A total of seven LockBit members have now been charged in the District of New Jersey. Beyond Panev and Khoroshev, other previously charged LockBit defendants include:</p><ul><li>In July, two LockBit affiliate members, Mikhail Vasiliev, also known as Ghostrider, Free, Digitalocean90, Digitalocean99, Digitalwaters99, and Newwave110, and Ruslan Astamirov, also known as BETTERPAY, offtitan, and Eastfarmer,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-foreign-nationals-plead-guilty-participating-lockbit-ransomware-group\">pleaded guilty</a> in the District of New Jersey for their participation in the LockBit ransomware group and admitted deploying multiple LockBit attacks against U.S. and foreign victims. Vasiliev and Astamirov are presently in custody awaiting sentencing.</li><li>In February, in parallel with the disruption operation described above, an indictment was unsealed in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev</a>, also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries. Sungatov and Kondratyev remain at large.</li><li>In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/mikhail-pavlovich-matveev\">Mikhail Matveev</a>, also known as Wazawaka, m1x, Boriselcin, and Uhodiransomwar, with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department.

Specifically, the conspirators, who worked for DPRK-controlled companies Yanbian Silverstar and Volasys Silverstar, located in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation (Russia), respectively, conspired to use false, stolen, and borrowed identities of U.S. and other persons to conceal their North Korean identities and foreign locations and obtain employment as remote information technology (IT) workers for U.S. companies and nonprofit organizations.</p><p>The conspirators, some of whom were ordered by their superiors to earn at least $10,000 per month, generated at least $88 million throughout the approximately six-year conspiracy. In multiple instances, the conspirators supplemented their employment earnings by stealing sensitive company information, such as proprietary source code, and then threatening to leak such information unless the employer made an extortion payment. Ultimately, the conspirators used the U.S. and PRC financial systems to remit the proceeds of their activity to accounts in the PRC for the ultimate benefit of the DPRK government.</p><p>\u201cTo prop up its brutal regime, the North Korean government directs IT workers to gain employment through fraud, steal sensitive information from U.S. companies, and siphon money back to the DPRK,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThis indictment of 14 North Korean nationals exposes their alleged sanctions evasion and should serve as a warning to companies around the globe \u2014 be on alert for this malicious activity by the DPRK regime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday\u2019s indictment is the latest in a series of actions under a National Security Division initiative launched earlier this year to disrupt North Korea\u2019s efforts to generate revenue by duping American companies into hiring its citizens for remote work,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s for National Security Division. \u201cThis indictment and associated disruptions highlight the cybersecurity dangers associated with this threat, including theft of sensitive business information for the purposes of extortion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fourteen conspirators indicted yesterday victimized companies across the United States, as well as many Americans whose identities they stole, to generate revenue for the North Korean regime,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThe FBI will continue to work with our partners to expose and mitigate these fraudulent IT schemes and provide unwavering support to victims of North Korean cyber actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth Korean IT workers pose a sophisticated and persistent threat, especially to businesses seeking to employ large numbers of contract workers quickly,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming for the Eastern District of Missouri.\u00a0\u201cNorth Korean IT workers continue to find ways to evade detection, so businesses need to closely vet employees to avoid having their sensitive data stolen and unwittingly funding North Korea\u2019s government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we have disrupted this group and identified its leadership, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The government of North Korea has trained and deployed thousands of IT workers to perpetrate this same scheme against U.S. companies every day,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ashley T. Johnson of the FBI St. Louis Field Office.\u00a0\u201cProtect your business by thoroughly vetting fully remote IT workers. One of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote.\u201d</p><p>Today\u2019s charges are the most recent step in an ongoing, two-year Department effort to disrupt this specific group of conspirators, one of multiple such DPRK groups attempting to generate revenue for the DPRK government through such schemes. Prior Department actions against this group include: (i) a January\u00a0 court authorized <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/1380221/dl\">seizure </a>of approximately $320,000 (unsealed today); (ii) a July court authorized <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1380226/dl\">seizure </a>of approximately $444,800 (unsealed today); (iii) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation\">previously announced</a> October 2022 and January 2023 court-authorized seizures of approximately $1.5 million; and (iv) previously announced <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation\">October 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-arrest-premises-search-and-seizures-multiple-website-domains\">May 2024</a>\u00a0court-authorized seizures of 29 internet domains used by the same group to increase the bona fides and appeal of their assumed identities to prospective employers.</p><p>In addition to these actions, the State Department announced today a\u00a0<a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/yanbian-silverstar-and-volasys-silverstar/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reward offer of up to $5 million</a>\u00a0for information on these companies, the individuals identified, their illicit activities, and/or those of associated individuals and entities. The identified individuals are: Jong Song Hwa (\uc815\uc131\ud654), Ri Kyong Sik (\ub9ac\uacbd\uc2dd), Kim Ryu Song (\uae40\ub958\uc131), Rim Un Chol (\ub9bc\uc740\ucca0), Kim Mu Rim (\uae40\ubb34\ub9bc), Cho Chung Pom (\uc870\ucda9\ubc94), Hyon Chol Song (\ud604\ucca0\uc131), Son Un Chol (\uc190\uc740\ucca0), Sok Kwang Hyok (\uc11d\uad11\ud601), Choe Jong Yong (\ucd5c\uc815\uc6a9), Ko Chung Sok (\uace0\ucda9\uc11d), Kim Ye Won (\uae40\uc608\uc6d0), Jong Kyong Chol (\uc815\uacbd\ucca0), and Jang Chol Myong (\uc7a5\ucca0\uba85). The State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice program has a standing rewards program for information that leads to the disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support the North Korean government, including work by highly skilled North Korean nationals sent abroad whose income generates funds for the DPRK regime.</p><p>The DPRK has dispatched thousands of skilled IT workers around the world, earning revenue that contributes to the North Korean regime with the aim of deceiving U.S. and other businesses worldwide into hiring them as remote IT workers to generate revenue in violation of U.S. and U.N. sanctions. DPRK IT worker schemes involve the use of pseudonymous email, social media, payment platform and online job site accounts, as well as false websites, proxy computers, virtual private networks, virtual private servers and unwitting third parties located in the United States and elsewhere. As described in a May 2022 tri-seal\u00a0<a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20220516?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public service advisory</a>\u00a0released by the FBI and its partners, which was updated in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2023/PSA231018\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">October 2023</a>, such IT workers can individually earn up to $300,000 annually, generating hundreds of millions of dollars collectively each year, on behalf of designated entities, such as the North Korean Ministry of Defense and others directly involved in the DPRK\u2019s UN-prohibited weapons of mass destruction programs. \u00a0</p><p>The indictment alleges that the 14 conspirators worked for sanctioned North Korean-controlled companies Yanbian Silverstar and Volasys Silverstar in capacities ranging from senior company leaders to IT workers. These two organizations collectively employed at least 130 North Korean IT workers \u2014 referred to within these organizations as \u201cIT Warriors.\u201d As alleged in the indictment, Yanbian Silverstar and Volasys Silverstar organized periodic \u201csocialism competitions\u201d for their employees. During these competitions, IT workers would compete to generate money for the DPRK. Bonuses and other prizes were awarded to the top performers during these competitions.\u00a0As part of their scheme, North Korean IT workers obtained salaried employment at numerous U.S.-based companies and nonprofit organizations. In some instances, U.S. employers unwittingly employed North Korean IT workers for years and paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary.</p><p>The conspirators used many techniques to conceal their North Korean identities from employers.\u00a0These included using stolen identities belonging to U.S. persons and others to apply for jobs; paying U.S. persons to attend job interviews and work meetings remotely under fake identities; and registering web domains and designing phony websites to convince prospective employers that the false identities were experienced, qualified, and previously employed by reputable contracting firms. As described in court documents, these websites contained indicia that should have aroused suspicion about their bona fides.\u00a0For example, some of the physical addresses listed on the websites were home addresses, not office buildings; contact telephone numbers listed on the fake companies\u2019 websites did not correspond to area codes of business locations; and the websites\u2019 content included disjointed or nonsensical phrases, such as, \u201cNor, moreover, is there anyone who loves pain because it is pain, pursues it, wants to gain it, but.\u201d</p><p>The conspirators also sought to avoid detection by paying U.S. persons to receive, set up, and host laptops sent from employers to the U.S. persons\u2019 home addresses (often referred to as laptop farms). After these laptops were set up, the conspirators instructed the U.S. persons to install software that allowed them to access the laptops from overseas.\u00a0By arranging to have laptops physically located in the United States, conspirators made it appear as if the fake U.S.-based employees were accessing laptops to do work, when in fact the IT workers were located outside the United States.</p><p>In some instances, the conspirators leveraged their access to proprietary corporate information to extort their U.S.-based employers for additional payments.\u00a0These threats were not empty \u2014 IT workers would at times publish the business\u2019s information online if they were not paid. One employer, for example, sustained hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages after it refused the extortion demand of a conspirator who then publicly released the employer\u2019s proprietary information.</p><p>All 14 conspirators are charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to commit identity theft. Eight conspirators are charged with aggravated identity theft.\u00a0If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum statutory penalty of 27 years in prison.</p><p>The FBI St. Louis Field Office investigated the case, with assistance from the FBI Cyber Division.</p><p>Trial Attorneys Jacques Singer-Emery and Alexandra Cooper-Ponte of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Drake for the Eastern District of Missouri are prosecuting the case. Substantial assistance was also provided Trial Attorney Emma Ellenrieder of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyle Bateman for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.</em></p></div>",

Guan and his co-conspirators worked at the offices of Sichuan Silence Information Technology Co. Ltd. to discover and exploit a previously-unknown vulnerability (an \u201c0-day\u201d vulnerability) in certain firewalls sold by U.K.-based Sophos Ltd. (Sophos) \u2013 an information technology company that develops and markets cybersecurity products. The malware that exploited the vulnerability discovered by Guan was designed to steal information from infected computers and to encrypt files on them if a victim attempted to remediate the infection. In total, Guan and his co-conspirators infected approximately 81,000 firewall devices worldwide, including a firewall device used by an agency of the United States.</p><p>\u201cThe defendant and his co-conspirators exploited a vulnerability in tens of thousands of network security devices, infecting them with malware designed to steal information from victims around the world,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment reflects the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to working with partners across government and across the globe to detect and hold accountable\u00a0malicious cyber actors based in China or elsewhere who pose a threat to global cybersecurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe defendant and his conspirators compromised tens of thousands of firewalls and then continued to hold at risk these devices, which protect computers in the United States and around the world,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen. \u201cThe Department of Justice will hold accountable those who contribute to the dangerous ecosystem of China-based enabling companies that carry out indiscriminate hacks on behalf of their sponsors and undermine global cybersecurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur law enforcement actions, technical expertise, and enduring partnerships with private companies, like Sophos, demonstrate the reputation of the FBI as being a reliable and effective partner for stopping this malicious activity,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division.\u00a0\u201cComplementary actions prevented further victimization of U.S. businesses and individuals\u00a0while contributing to the safety of U.S. citizens as they use the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment underscores our commitment to protecting the public from malicious actors who use security research as a cover to identify vulnerabilities in widely used systems and exploit them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Clifford D. Johnson for the Northern District of Indiana. \u201cGuan Tianfeng and his co-conspirators placed thousands of computer networks, including a network in the Northern District of Indiana, at risk by conducting this attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe zero-day vulnerability Guan Tianfeng and his co-conspirators found and exploited affected firewalls owned by businesses across the United States, including in Indiana,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Herbert J. Stapleton of the FBI Indianapolis Field Office. \u201cIf Sophos had not rapidly identified the vulnerability and deployed a comprehensive response, the damage could have been far more severe.\u00a0Sophos\u2019s efforts combined with the dedication and expertise of our cyber squad\u00a0formed a powerful partnership resulting in the\u00a0mitigation of\u00a0this threat.\u201d</p><p><u>The Conspiracy to Exploit Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 2020-12271</u></p><p>As alleged in the indictment, in 2020, Guan and his co-conspirators developed, tested, and deployed malware that targeted approximately 81,000 Sophos firewalls using a 0-day vulnerability that existed on those devices. The 81,000 Sophos firewalls were located throughout the world, including within victim organizations located in the Northern District of Indiana. The vulnerability was later designated CVE 2020-12271.</p><p>Guan and his co-conspirators designed the malware to steal information from firewalls. To better hide their activity, Guan and his co-conspirators registered and used domains designed to look like they were controlled by Sophos, such as sophosfirewallupdate.com. Sophos discovered the intrusion and remediated its customers\u2019 firewalls in approximately two days, which caused the co-conspirators to modify their malware. As modified, the malware was designed to deploy encryption software from a ransomware variant in the event the victims attempted to remove the malware. Their encryption efforts did not succeed, but demonstrated the conspirators\u2019 disregard for the harm that they would cause to victims.</p><p><u>Guan Tianfeng\u2019s Employment and Sichuan Silence\u2019s Relationship with the PRC Government</u></p><p>According to court documents, Guan worked for Sichuan Silence, a PRC-based private company that has provided services to the PRC Ministry of Public Security, among other PRC organizations. According to Sichuan Silence\u2019s website, it developed a product line which could be used to scan and detect overseas network targets in order to obtain valuable intelligence information.</p><p>In October, Sophos released a number of articles chronicling its separate long-running investigation, \u201c<a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/10/31/pacific-rim-neutralizing-china-based-threat/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Rim</a>.\u201d Sophos detailed PRC-based advanced persistent threat groups targeting its networking appliances for over five years, which it described as \u201cunusually knowledgeable about the internal architecture of the device firmware.\u201d One of the attacks described in the Pacific Rim report involved CVE-2020-12271.</p><p>Soon after the Sophos announcements in October, the FBI issued a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/edge-device-intrusions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">call for information</a>\u00a0regarding computer intrusions into Sophos edge devices.

We are especially grateful to our domestic and foreign law enforcement partners, like South Korea, whose collaboration is essential to disrupting and deterring the most significant cybercriminal threats facing the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time, cybercriminals will be caught and brought to justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. \u201cAccording to the indictment, Ptitsyn\u00a0facilitated the worldwide use of a dangerous ransomware strain to target corporations and various organizations, including government agencies, healthcare facilities, educational institutions, and critical infrastructure. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland is committed to bringing cybercriminals to justice and working with the private sector and the academic community to prevent and disrupt their activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI is working tirelessly to ensure that ransomware actors, both developers and affiliates, face the consequences of their actions,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWe know it takes strong partnerships to disrupt cybercriminal networks, and the FBI must thank our partners for the important roles they play in carrying out this mission. The extradition announced today would not have been possible without their assistance.\u201d</p><p>As alleged in the indictment, beginning in at least November 2020, Ptitsyn and others conspired to engage in an international computer hacking and extortion scheme that victimized public and private entities through the deployment of Phobos ransomware.</p><p>As part of the scheme, Ptitsyn and his co-conspirators allegedly developed and offered access to Phobos ransomware to other criminals or \u201caffiliates\u201d for the purposes of encrypting victims\u2019 data and extorting ransom payments from victims. The administrators operated a darknet website to coordinate the sale and distribution of Phobos ransomware to co-conspirators and used online monikers to advertise their services on criminal forums and messaging platforms. At relevant times, Ptitsyn allegedly used the monikers \u201cderxan\u201d and \u201czimmermanx.\u201d</p><p>Affiliates would then allegedly hack into the victims\u2019 computer networks, often using stolen or otherwise unauthorized credentials; copy and steal files and programs on the victims\u2019 networks; and encrypt the original versions of the stolen data on the networks by installing and executing Phobos ransomware. Affiliates then extorted the victims for ransom payments in exchange for the decryption keys to regain access to encrypted data by leaving ransom notes on compromised victims\u2019 computers and by calling and emailing victims to initiate the ransom payment negotiations. Affiliates also threatened to expose victims\u2019 stolen files to the public or to the victims\u2019 clients, customers, or constituents if the ransoms were not paid.</p><p>After a successful Phobos ransomware attack, criminal affiliates paid fees to Phobos administrators like Ptitsyn for a decryption key to regain access to the encrypted files. Each deployment of Phobos ransomware was assigned a unique alphanumeric string in order to match it to the corresponding decryption key, and each affiliate was directed to pay the decryption key fee to a cryptocurrency wallet unique to that affiliate. From December 2021 to April 2024, the decryption key fees were then transferred from the unique affiliate cryptocurrency wallet to a wallet controlled by Ptitsyn.</p><p>Ptitsyn is charged in a 13-count indictment with wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, four counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, and four counts of extortion in relation to hacking.\u00a0If convicted, Ptitsyn faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count; 10 years in prison for each computer hacking count; and five years in prison for conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The FBI Baltimore Field Office is investigating the case.\u00a0The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs worked with the International Criminal Affairs Division of the Korean Ministry of Justice to secure the arrest and extradition of Ptitsyn. The Justice Department extends its thanks to international judicial and law enforcement partners in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Japan, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, France, and Romania, as well as Europol and the U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, for their cooperation and coordination with the Phobos ransomware investigation. The Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division also provided valuable assistance.</p><p>Senior Counsel Aarash A. Haghighat of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Thomas M. Sullivan for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case. CCIPS Trial Attorney Riane Harper and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey J. Izant for the District of Maryland provided substantial assistance.</p><p>Additional details on protecting networks against Phobos ransomware are available at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware\">StopRansomware.gov</a>, including Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Advisory AA24-060A.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

Teixeira, was sentenced to 15 years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Teixeira was also barred from having contact with foreign agents.",
    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A former member of the U.S. Air National Guard (USANG), Jack Douglas Teixeira, 22, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, was sentenced today in federal court in Boston for retaining and transmitting hundreds of pages of classified National Defense Information (NDI), including many documents designated top secret, on an online social media platform in 2022 and 2023. Teixeira, was sentenced to 15 years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Teixeira was also barred from having contact with foreign agents.</p><p>In March, Teixeira pleaded guilty to six counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information relating to the national defense. Teixeira was arrested in April 2023 and charged by criminal complaint with retention and transmission of NDI and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials. He was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury in Boston in June 2023. He has remained in federal custody since his arrest.</p><p>\u201cJack Teixeira repeatedly shared classified national defense information on a social media platform in an attempt to impress anonymous friends on the internet \u2013 instead, it has landed him a 15 year sentence in federal prison,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cTeixeira\u2019s profound breach of trust endangered our country\u2019s national security and that of our allies.\u00a0This sentence demonstrates the seriousness of the obligation to protect our country\u2019s secrets and the safety of the American people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sentencing is a stark warning to all those entrusted with protecting national defense information: betray that trust, and you will be held accountable,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cJack Teixeira\u2019s criminal conduct placed our nation, our troops, and our allies at great risk. The FBI will continue to work diligently with our partners to protect classified information and ensure that those who turn their backs on their country face justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Teixeira is responsible for engaging in one of the most significant leaks of classified documents and information in United States history, which resulted in exceptionally grave and long-lasting damage to the national security of the United States,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District of Massachusetts. \u201cHe exploited his Top-Secret security clearance to share critical defense information online. In doing so, he exposed sensitive defense information involving our allies, putting our intelligence community and our troops at risk. It is vital that our classified information remains just that \u2013 classified. Leaking and distributing this kind of information poses significant and real consequences across the globe. This is disturbing conduct that will not go unnoticed and unchecked.\u201d</p><p>Teixeira enlisted in the USANG in September 2019. Until his arrest in 2023, he served with the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis USANG Base in Massachusetts as a Cyber Defense Operations Journeyman. Teixeira's primary responsibility was maintaining and troubleshooting the classified workstations of other members of the 102nd Intelligence Wing. In order to perform his job, Teixeira was granted a Top-Secret//Sensitive Compartmented Information security clearance in 2021. Beginning in or around January 2022, Teixeira unlawfully retained and transmitted NDI classified as \u201cTOP SECRET\u201d or \u201cSECRET\u201d and/or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), onto the social media platform Discord to persons not authorized to receive such information.</p><p>Teixeira used a secure workstation at the Otis USANG Base to conduct hundreds of searches for classified documents containing NDI that were unrelated to his duties. On two separate occasions, Teixeira\u2019s superiors warned him not to take notes on classified intelligence information and to stop conducting \u201cdeep dives\u201d into classified intelligence information. Despite these warnings and his considerable training, Teixeira purposefully and repeatedly removed classified information and documents containing NDI without authorization from the secure facility where he worked. Teixeira subsequently transmitted the information by typing it into an online social media platform, where it was further transmitted by other users. Teixeira also posted images of hundreds of classified documents to a social media platform, nearly all of which bore standard classification markings \u2013 including \u201cSECRET,\u201d \u201cTOP SECRET\u201d and SCI designations \u2013 indicating that they contained highly classified U.S. government information. The documents and information illegally disseminated by Teixeira discussed a range of topics including descriptions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and troop movements on a particular date. The information he retained and disseminated was derived from sensitive U.S. intelligence, gathered through classified sources and methods.</p><p>Shortly before his arrest in April 2022, Teixeira took steps to conceal his disclosures by destroying and disposing of his electronic devices, deleting his online accounts, and encouraging his online acquaintances to do the same.</p><p>The FBI Washington and Boston Field Offices investigated the case. Valuable assistance was provided by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nadine Pellegrini, Jared C. Dolan, and Jason A. Casey for the District of Massachusetts and Trial Attorney Christina A. Clark of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section prosecuted the case.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>An Alabama man was arrested by the FBI this morning in Athens, Alabama, on charges related to the January\u00a0hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>According to court documents, on or about Jan. 9, Eric Council Jr., 25, of Athens, allegedly conspired with others to take unauthorized control of the SEC\u2019s X account and, in the name of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, prematurely announced the approval of bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds. Immediately following the false announcement, the price of bitcoin increased by more than $1,000 per bitcoin. Shortly after this unauthorized post, the SEC regained control over its X account and confirmed that the announcement was unauthorized and the result of a security breach. Following this corrective disclosure, the value of BTC decreased by more than $2,000 per bitcoin.</p><p>The conspirators gained control of the SEC\u2019s X account through an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap, allegedly carried out by Council. A SIM swap refers to the process of fraudulently inducing a cell phone carrier to reassign a cell phone number from the legitimate subscriber or user\u2019s SIM card to a SIM card controlled by a criminal actor. As part of the scheme, Council and the co-conspirators allegedly created a fraudulent identification document in the victim\u2019s name, which Council used to impersonate the victim; took over the victim\u2019s cellular telephone account; and accessed the online social media account linked to the victim\u2019s cellular phone number for the purpose of accessing the SEC\u2019s X account and generating the fraudulent post in the name of SEC Chairman Gensler.</p><p>\u201cThe indictment alleges that Eric Council Jr. unlawfully accessed the SEC\u2019s account on X by using the stolen identity of a person who had access to the account to take over their cellphone number,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cCouncil\u2019s co-conspirators then allegedly used this unauthorized access to the X account to falsely announce that the SEC had approved listing bitcoin ETFs, which caused the price of bitcoin to rise by $1,000 and then fall by $2,000. Council\u2019s indictment underscores the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to countering cybercrime, especially when it threatens the integrity of financial markets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese SIM swapping schemes, where fraudsters trick service providers into giving them control of unsuspecting victims\u2019 phones, can result in devastating financial losses to victims and leaks of sensitive personal and private information,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cHere, the conspirators allegedly used their illegal access to a phone to manipulate financial markets.\u00a0Through indictments like this, we will hold accountable those who commit these serious crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe defendant allegedly deceived the public by impersonating the victim and making fraudulent statements on behalf of the SEC,\u201d said Assistant Director Chad Yarbrough of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThe FBI and our partners will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to manipulate financial markets for their own gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI works to identify, disrupt, and investigate cyber-enabled frauds, including SIM swapping,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge David E. Geist of the FBI Washington Field Office Criminal and Cyber Division. \u201cSIM swapping is a method bad actors exploit to illicitly access sensitive information of an individual or company, with the intent of perpetrating a crime. In this case,\u00a0the unauthorized actor allegedly utilized SIM swapping to manipulate the global financial market. The FBI will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners around the country and globe to hold accountable those who break U.S. laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis criminal indictment demonstrates our commitment to holding bad actors accountable for undermining the integrity of the financial markets,\u201d said Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey of the SEC.</p><p>A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment on Oct. 10 charging Council with one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The FBI Washington Field Office and SEC Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.</p><p>Trial Attorney Ashley Pungello of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney Lauren Archer of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Rosenberg for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case.</p><p>For more information on SIM swapping, go to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240411\">www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240411</a>.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0\u201cWorking closely with private-sector partners such as Microsoft, the National Security Division uses the full reach of our authorities to confront the cyber-enabled threats of tomorrow from Russia and other adversaries.\u201d</p><p>\"Working in close collaboration with public and private sector partners\u2014in this case through the execution of domain seizures \u2014 we remain in prime position to counter and defeat a broad range of cyber threats posed by adversaries,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cOur efforts to prevent the theft of information by state-sponsored criminal actors are relentless, and we will continue our work in this arena with partners who share our common goals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seizure is part of a coordinated response with our private sector partners to dismantle the infrastructure that cyber espionage actors use to attack U.S. and international targets,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J.

Ryzhenkov and his conspirators then allegedly deployed the strain of ransomware known as BitPaymer and used it to encrypt the files of the victim companies, rendering them inaccessible. An electronic note left on the victims\u2019 systems contained a ransom demand and instructions on how to contact the attackers to begin ransom negotiations. Ryzhenkov and his conspirators allegedly demanded that victims pay a ransom to obtain a decryption key and prevent their sensitive information from being made public online.</p><p>The indictment further alleges that Ryzhenkov and others used a variety of methods to intrude into computer systems, including phishing campaigns, malware, and taking advantage of vulnerabilities in computer hardware and software. Ryzhenkov and coconspirators used this access to demand millions of dollars in ransom. Ryzhenkov is believed to be in Russia.

The designation blocks property and interests in any property the designee may have in the United States and prohibits U.S. financial institutions from engaging in certain transactions and activities with the designated individual.

With law enforcement partners here and around the world, we will continue to put victims first and show these criminals that, in the end, they will be the ones paying for their crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI, together with partners, continues to leverage all resources to impose cost on criminals engaging in ransomware attacks,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment delivers a clear message to those who engage in cyber-criminal activity \u2013 you will face severe consequences for your illicit activities and will be held accountable under the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAleksandr Ryzhenkov extorted victim businesses throughout the United States by encrypting their confidential information and holding it for ransom,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cAddressing the threat from ransomware groups is one of the Criminal Division\u2019s highest priorities. The coordinated actions announced today demonstrate, yet again, that the Justice Department is committed to working with its partners to take an all-tools approach to protecting victims and holding cybercriminals accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansomware attacks \u2013 particularly those deployed by bad actors with ties to Russia \u2013 can paralyze a company in the time it takes to open a laptop. Whether or not the ransom is paid, recovering from a ransomware attack is generally costly and time-consuming,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton for the Northern District of Texas. \u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas is committed to pursuing cybercriminals who hold data hostage, no matter where in the world they may be hiding.\u201d</p><p>The FBI Dallas Field Office is investigating the case.</p><p>Trial Attorney Debra L. Ireland of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Vincent J.

The activity was part of Iran\u2019s continuing efforts to stoke discord, erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process, and unlawfully acquire information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the malign activities of the IRGC, including ongoing efforts to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the IRGC \u2013 Qods Force (IRGC-QF).</p><p>As alleged, in or around May, after several years of focusing on compromising the accounts of former U.S. government officials, the conspirators used some of the same hacking infrastructure from earlier in the conspiracy to begin targeting and successfully gaining unauthorized access to personal accounts belonging to persons associated with an identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 1), including campaign officials. The conspirators used their access to those accounts to steal, among other information, non-public campaign documents and emails (campaign material). The activity broadened in late June, when the conspirators engaged in a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d operation, in which they sought to weaponize campaign material stolen from U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 by leaking such materials to members of the media and individuals associated with what was then another identified U.S. Presidential campaign (U.S. Presidential Campaign 2), in a deliberate effort to, as reflected in the conspirators\u2019 own words and actions, undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>\u201cThe Justice Department is working relentlessly to uncover and counter Iran\u2019s cyberattacks aimed at stoking discord, undermining confidence in our democratic institutions, and influencing our elections,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B.

So today the FBI would like to send a message to the Government of Iran \u2013 you and your hackers can\u2019t hide behind your keyboards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese hack-and-leak efforts by Iran are a direct assault on the integrity of our democratic processes,\u201d\u00a0said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G.

This case demonstrates our commitment to expose attempts by the Iranian regime or any other foreign actor to interfere with our free and open society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis indictment alleges a serious and sustained effort by a state-sponsored terrorist organization to gather intelligence through hacking personal accounts so they can use the hacked materials to harm Americans and corruptly influence our election,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cThe detailed allegations in the indictment should make clear to anyone who might attempt to do the same that the Justice Department has the ability to gather evidence of such crimes from around the globe, will charge those who commit such crimes, and will do whatever we can to bring those charged to justice.\u201d</p><p>As alleged in the indictment, beginning in or around January 2020, Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi, working on behalf of the IRGC, commenced a wide-ranging hacking campaign that used spearphishing and social engineering techniques to target and compromise victims computers and accounts. Among the conspirators\u2019 techniques were: using virtual private networks and virtual private servers to obscure their true location; creating fraudulent email accounts in the names of prominent U.S. persons and international institutions; creating spoofed login pages to harvest account credentials; sending spearphishing emails using compromised victim accounts; and using social engineering to obtain victims\u2019 login information and multi-factor recovery/authentication codes. Some of the conspirators\u2019 efforts were successful, while others were not.</p><p>In April 2019, the Department of State designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. Among the purposes of the conspiracy were for the conspirators to: (i) steal victims\u2019 data, such as information related to U.S. government and foreign policy information concerning the Middle East; (ii) steal information relating to current and former U.S. officials that could be used to advance the IRGC\u2019s malign activities; (iii) disrupt U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East; (iv) stoke discord and erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process; (v) steal personal and private information from persons who had access to information relating to U.S. Presidential Campaign 1, including non-public campaign material and information; and (vi) undermine U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 in advance of the 2024 U.S. presidential election by leaking stolen campaign material and information.</p><p>As reflected in the Sept. 18 <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-091824\">joint statement</a>\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: \u201cIranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden\u2019s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former Trump\u2019s campaign as text in the emails. There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump\u2019s campaign to U.S. media organizations.\u201d</p><p>As alleged in further detail in the indictment, the conspirators\u2019 hack-and-leak efforts involved the conspirators emailing stolen campaign material to individuals that the conspirators believed were associated with what was then U.S. Presidential Campaign 2 and members of the media.</p><p>First, between on or about June 27 and July 3, the conspirators sent or forwarded an unsolicited email message to personal accounts of three persons that the conspirators believed were associated with U.S. Presidential Campaign 2. The June 27 email was sent to two recipients, and then forwarded the same day to another account for one of those recipients (due to the earlier email being sent to an invalid account for that recipient). This email chain contained campaign material stolen from an official for U.S. Presidential Campaign 1 (U.S. Victim 11). Neither of the recipients replied to the conspirators\u2019 email. In addition, the conspirators sent a follow up email on July 3rd to a third recipient\u2019s account, and the recipient similarly did not reply to the Conspirators.</p><p>Second, between on or about July 22 and on or about Aug. 31, the conspirators distributed other campaign material stolen from U.S. Victim 11 regarding U.S. Presidential Campaign 1\u2019s potential vice-presidential candidates to multiple members of the news media, in an attempt to induce the news media to publish the material. In one instance, for example, the conspirators\u2019 message stated \u201cI think this information is worth a good [U.S. news publication] piece with your narration. Let me know your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>As alleged, these defendants also sought to promote the IRGC\u2019s goals and mission by compromising and maintaining unauthorized access to the email accounts of a number of former government officials, including U.S. Victim 1, who had served in a position with responsibility over U.S. Middle East policy at the time of Qasam Soleimani\u2019s death. Using this access, the defendants obtained information to assist the IRGC\u2019s efforts to target U.S. Victim 1 and others, including their means of identification, correspondence, travel information, lodging information and other information regarding their whereabouts and policy positions. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi are charged with: conspiracy to commit identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, unauthorized access to computers to obtain information from a protected computer, unauthorized access to computers to defraud and obtain a thing of value, and wire fraud, all while knowingly falsely registering domain names, which carries a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison; conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; eight counts of wire fraud while falsely registering domain names, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 27 years in prison; and eight counts of aggravated identity theft, each of which carries a mandatory minimum penalty of two years in prison. If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>Concurrent with today\u2019s announcement, the Department of State, through the Rewards for Justice Program, issued a <a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/irgc-hackers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reward</a> of up to $10 million for information on Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi, the IRGC\u2019s interference in U.S. elections, or associated individuals and entities. Also, concurrent with today\u2019s announcement, the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, and E.O. 13848 <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2621\">designated</a> Jalili for being responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, a cyber-enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose or effect of causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.</p><p>The FBI Washington Field Office is investigating this case. The FBI Cyber Division and Springfield and Minneapolis Field Offices provided substantial assistance in this matter. For more information on threat activity as well as mitigation guidance, the FBI has <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2024/240927.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> a Joint Cyber Security Advisory titled \u201cIranian Cyber Actors Targeting Personal Accounts to Support Operations.\u201d</p><p>The Justice Department would like to thank the following private sector partners for their assistance with this case: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Meta.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tejpal Chawla and Christopher Tortorice for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Greg Nicosia of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from Paralegal Specialists Mariela Andrade and Kate Abrey. Joshua Champagne of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section also provided valuable assistance.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department today announced actions coordinated with the Department of State, Department of the Treasury, and other federal and international law enforcement partners to combat Russian money laundering operations. The actions involved the unsealing of an indictment charging a Russian national with his involvement in operating multiple money laundering services that catered to cybercriminals, as well as the seizure of websites associated with three illicit cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>\u201cToday's actions highlight the Department\u2019s continued disruption of malicious cyber actors and their criminal ecosystem,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThe two Russian nationals charged today allegedly pocketed millions of dollars from prolific money laundering and fueled a network of cyber criminals around the world, with Ivanov allegedly facilitating darknet drug traffickers and ransomware operators. Working with our Dutch partners, we shut down Cryptex, an illicit crypto exchange and recovered millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCryptex promised its cybercriminal customers a safe space to launder their illicit proceeds anonymously,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0\u201cBut the coordinated actions announced today \u2014 including seizing the Cryptex domains, servers, and proceeds \u2014 should put cybercriminals on notice that there are no safe spaces for cybercriminals online. The Criminal Division will continue to work with its domestic and international partnerships to disrupt platforms that enable cybercrime and render those platforms unprofitable.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEvery step cybercriminals take in their pursuit of money leaves another track that leads us to their doorstep,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cAnd if you follow them on their path of greed, they will lead us to you. We will not stop, because while domains can always be seized, justice is unyielding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Secret Service is relentless in pursuing those engaged in criminal activity,\u201d said Assistant Director Brian Lambert of the U.S. Secret Service. \u201cI thank our domestic and foreign partners for their efforts on this case, as we continue our work bringing to justice those engaged in transnational criminal activity.\u201d</p><p>According to court documents unsealed today in the Eastern District of Virginia, Russian national Sergey Ivanov, known online as \u201cTaleon,\u201d among other aliases, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit and aid and abet bank fraud for providing payment processing support to the carding website Rescator, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering for laundering proceeds from the carding website Joker\u2019s Stash. \u201cCarding\u201d is the unlawful acquisition of and trade in stolen credit and debit card information for fraudulent purposes. Ivanov allegedly operated for nearly two decades as a professional cyber money launderer, advertising his services to other cybercriminals on exclusive Russian-speaking criminal forums. Over the years, Ivanov\u2019s laundering services and payment systems have catered to cybercrime marketplaces, ransomware groups, and hackers responsible for significant data breaches of major U.S. companies.</p><p>Ivanov allegedly created and/or operated Russian payment and exchange services UAPS, PinPays, and PM2BTC, which provided money transfer and laundering services directly to criminals. Cryptocurrency blockchain analysis revealed that between July 12, 2013, and Aug. 10, cryptocurrency addresses associated with Ivanov\u2019s alleged money laundering services conducted transactions totaling approximately $1.15 billion in value. Approximately 32% of all traced bitcoin sent to these addresses originated from other cryptocurrency addresses associated with criminal activity. For example, more than $158 million of bitcoin flowing into Ivanov\u2019s addresses allegedly represented fraud proceeds, more than $8.8 million allegedly represented proceeds from known ransomware payments, and approximately $4.7 million allegedly originated from darknet drug markets. The U.S. Secret Service has obtained court authorization to seize domains associated with the UAPS and PM2BTC websites.</p><p>The Rescator carding website allegedly sold stolen payment card data from U.S. financial institutions and personally identifiable information (PII) of U.S. citizens. For example, the website allegedly advertised the sale of data from up to 40 million payment cards and the PII of approximately 70 million people that had been stolen from a major U.S. retail victim in 2013. The breach cost the U.S. retail victim at least $202 million in expenses and caused damage to the U.S. retail victim\u2019s customers, who became targets of identity theft by other cybercriminals. Ivanov allegedly provided payment processing support for the Rescator carding site through the UAPS and PinPays services for purchases made on the site using bitcoin.</p><p>Additionally, Russian national Timur Shakhmametov, known online as \u201cJokerStash\u201d and \u201cVega,\u201d among other aliases, is charged in the same indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit and aid and abet bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering related to his work in operating the carding website Joker\u2019s Stash and laundering the proceeds. Joker\u2019s Stash offered for sale data from approximately 40 million payment cards annually, totaling hundreds of millions of payment cards overall, and was one of the largest known carding markets in history. Estimates of its profits range from $280 million to more than $1 billion. Shakhmametov and others allegedly promoted Joker\u2019s Stash and its products by advertising the Joker\u2019s Stash website and its stolen payment card data on numerous online cybercrime forums.</p><p>Separately, the U.S. Secret Service executed a seizure order from the District of Maryland against two website domain names used to support the cryptocurrency money laundering exchange \u201cCryptex.net.\u201d According to court records unsealed today, Cryptex.net and Cryptex.one were associated with the administration and operation of Cryptex, which offers complete anonymity to Cryptex users by allowing them to register for accounts without providing know-your-customer compliance requirements. Like UAPS and PM2BTC, Cryptex advertised itself directly to cybercriminals.</p><p>According to a company that provides blockchain analytics services to law enforcement, there have been more than 37,500 transactions involving bitcoin addresses associated with Cryptex, amounting to a total value of approximately 62,586 bitcoin, or $1.4 billion at the time the transactions were made. Of that amount, about 31% of the bitcoin sent, or $441 million, originated from cryptocurrency addresses associated with criminal conduct, including $297 million of fraud proceeds and more than $115 million of proceeds from ransomware payments. Nine percent of all bitcoin sent to Cryptex, or $162 million, originated from cryptocurrency addresses associated with services often used by cybercriminals. Further, 28% of all bitcoin sent from Cryptex was sent to companies or darknet markets sanctioned by the United States.</p><p>The seizure of these domains by the government will prevent the owners and third parties from using the sites for money laundering. Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by the federal government.</p><p>As part of the coordinated actions taken today, our Dutch partners seized the servers hosting PM2BTC and Cryptex. Those servers have been taken offline at various locations around the world, and the Dutch have seized cryptocurrency from those servers worth over $7 million.</p><p>In coordination with the department\u2019s actions, other U.S. government agencies and foreign law enforcement partners are also taking related actions. The\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/transnational-organized-crime-rewards-program-offers-for-two-russian-nationals-and-sanctions-on-illicit-russian-virtual-currency-exchanges-and-cybercrime-facilitator/\">U.S. Department of State issued reward offers up to $11 million</a> through its Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Ivanov and others involved in the operation of his money laundering services, and for Shakhmametov and others involved in the operation of Joker\u2019s Stash.

Axelrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cAs today\u2019s announcements make clear, our efforts to protect sensitive U.S. technologies \u2013 which to date have yielded 24 publicly charged criminal cases, millions of dollars in administrative penalties, and multiple Entity List additions \u2013 remain relentless and unyielding.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the threats we face today are more complex and severe than ever before,\u201d\u00a0said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch.\u00a0\u201cThe best way \u2013 and the only way \u2013 we can stay ahead of current and emerging threats is by working together. With these indictments, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an excellent example of the power of partnerships in practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose who facilitate the illegal proliferation of sensitive technologies and material to hostile nations and terrorist groups pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the United States,\u201d said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). \u201cHSI is committed to working with our partners to disrupt and dismantle the criminal networks that aid and abed U.S. adversaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDisrupting the efforts of foreign nations, international criminal organizations, and other potentially hostile entities that seek to illegally obtain sensitive DoD technology and weapon systems that could potentially be used against our military forces remains a top priority of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General,\u201d said Inspector General Robert P. Storch of DoD. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Justice Department and our strike force partners to thwart the efforts of criminal elements whose activities threaten the security of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><strong><u>United States v. Postovoy (District of Columbia)</u></strong></em></p>\n<p>A federal grand jury returned a seven-count <a href=\"https://vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fd9%2F2024-09%2Fpostovoy_indictment.pdf%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/01000191fc316fb7-a0c18aa9-ef45-4a06-9f03-641365edc815-000000/y4m3Z8nKwA2V9M8didJQRZZh4fc=391\">indictment</a> charging Denis Postovoy, a Russian citizen living in the United States, with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. HSI arrested Postovoy this morning in Sarasota, Florida.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, beginning in at least February 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Postovoy procured and illicitly exported from the United States to Russia microelectronic components with military applications. The exported microelectronics can be used in UAVs or drones. Through a web of companies that he owns or operates in Russia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, Postovoy and individuals in his network purchased the microelectronics from U.S.-based distributors and exported them to Russia without the required licenses from the Department of Commerce.</p>\n<p>As alleged, Postovoy\u2019s companies included WowCube HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong, Jove HK Limited, all based in Hong Kong, and the Vector Group in Russia. Postovoy repeatedly concealed and misstated the true end users and end destinations of the microelectronics by submitting false information on export-related documents. He transshipped items that were ultimately destined for Russia through intermediary destinations, including Hong Kong, Switzerland and elsewhere, and received payments in U.S. dollars from foreign bank accounts. His companies transferred funds for the purchase and shipment of the goods through bank accounts in Hong Kong, Russia, and elsewhere to bank accounts in the United States, including bank accounts maintained by the U.S. suppliers of microelectronics and other sensitive technologies.</p>\n<p>HSI is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Allen for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em><strong><u>United States v. Song Wu (Northern District of Georgia)</u></strong></em></p>\n<p>Today, a federal court in Atlanta, unsealed an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-09/song_wu_-_indictment_ndga_-_unsealed.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">indictment</a> charging Chinese national, Song Wu, 39, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft arising from his efforts to fraudulently obtain computer software and source code created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), research universities, and private companies. Song remains at large.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Song allegedly engaged in a multi-year \u201cspear phishing\u201d email campaign in which he created email accounts to impersonate U.S.-based researchers and engineers and then used those imposter accounts to obtain specialized restricted or proprietary software used for aerospace engineering and computational fluid dynamics. This specialized software could be used for industrial and military applications, such as development of advanced tactical missiles and aerodynamic design and assessment of weapons.</p>\n<p>In executing the scheme, Song allegedly sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with the U.S. government, including NASA, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Song also sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with major research universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, and with private sector companies that work in the aerospace field. Song\u2019s spear phishing emails appeared to the targeted victims as having been sent by a colleague, associate, friend, or other person in the research or engineering community. His emails requested that the targeted victim send or make available source code or software to which Song believed the targeted victim had access.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, while conducting this spear phishing campaign, Song was employed as an engineer at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Beijing. AVIC manufactures civilian and military aircrafts and is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.</p>\n<p>In total, Song is charged with 14 counts of wire fraud and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, Song faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud. Song also faces a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for aggravated identity theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI and the NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal for the Northern District of Georgia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division's Cyber Section are prosecuting the case with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p><em><strong><u>United States v.

Bhambhani was arrested on Sept. 9 and was released on conditions following an initial appearance in federal court in Boston. Teslenko remains at large overseas.</p>\n<p>It is alleged that from in or around 2015 through at least 2021, Bhambhani and Teslenko conspired to export laser welding machines from Bhambhani\u2019s employer in the United States to the Ural Electromechanical Plant (UEMZ) in Yekaterinburg, Russia, while falsifying the export documentation submitted to the U.S. government in order to conceal the fact that the UEMZ was the true end user of the machines. The UEMZ is a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian state corporation headquartered in Moscow, that oversaw Russia\u2019s civilian and military nuclear program. According to the indictment, Teslenko knew that the laser welding machines were intended for the portion of the UEMZ involving the Russian nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>The charge of smuggling provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000.

As alleged, Goodarzi purchased U.S.-origin aircraft components from U.S.-based suppliers and then exported them to Iran \u2013 typically through Dubai, UAE. He also traveled to and from Iran multiple times per year and concealed aircraft parts and other items in his checked luggage. Goodarzi exchanged multiple emails with suppliers and customers, acknowledging that parts could not be shipped to Iran because of sanctions.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that on several occasions, authorities searched Goodarzi\u2019s luggage and found numerous aircraft parts and components hidden within articles of clothing. Some of the items had characteristics consistent with parts for the production of UAVs, as well as parts with electrical motor and generator applications. Goodarzi does not have the required licenses to export such items to sanctioned countries, including Iran, according to the complaint.</p>\n<p>The FBI, with assistance from and Customs and Border Protection, is investigating the case.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Heather Winter for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Christopher Cook of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b><i><u>United States v.

Some of these components are for use on military aircraft operated by Iran\u2019s armed forces, including the F-4 fighter jet.</p>\n<p>Nader, acting on purchase orders he received from customers in Iran, would coordinate the purchase of relevant aircraft components with business associates in Iran, by which they would reach out to U.S.-based suppliers of such components. In several instances, Nader identified himself and his company, California-based Pro Aero Capital, to these U.S.-based suppliers as the end-user of these items. Victim companies in this procurement scheme were located across the United States.</p>\n<p>Once the aircraft components were obtained, Nader attempted to export the items on multiple separate occasions. The items were then transshipped to the ultimate customer in Iran. None of the transactions discussed in the indictment were successfully exported; they were detained on export by a Special Agent with the Department of Commerce.</p>\n<p>This case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security.

In March 2017, Wei and his co-conspirators accessed the U.S. company\u2019s network without authorization approximately two days after the U.S. company filed a civil action against a China-based competitor for theft of communication-device trade secrets. Through this unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators stole U.S. company documents relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s civilian and military communication devices, product development, testing plans, internal product evaluations and commercial information about competitors. These documents pertained to some of the same technology and information that the China-based competitor stole from the U.S. company, as alleged in the civil action. In addition, Wei and his co-conspirators stole documents from the U.S. company discussing the China-based competitor.</p>\n<p>During his unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators attempted to install malicious software designed to provide persistent unauthorized access to the U.S. company\u2019s network.

All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.\u201d That same day, the defendants offered the hacked data for sale on the internet.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/attribution-of-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-against-ukraine\">previously</a> joined with allies and partners in May 2022 to attribute this cyber-attack to the Russian military and to condemn the attack and similar destructive cyber activities against Ukraine.</p>\n<p>In October 2022, the defendants also hacked the transportation infrastructure of a Central European country that was supporting Ukraine. Beginning in August 2021, the defendants also probed a variety of protected computer systems including those associated with 26 NATO member countries, searching for potential vulnerabilities. The indictment further alleges that from Aug. 5, 2021, to Feb. 3, 2022, the defendants leveraged the same computer infrastructure they used in the Ukraine-related attacks to probe computers belonging to a federal government agency in Maryland in the same manner as they had initially probed the Ukrainian Government networks.</p>\n<p>This indictment is part of an international effort, Operation Toy Soldier, to combat the malicious cyber activity by Unit 29155 of the GRU.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>WASHINGTON \u2013 A Belarussian and Ukrainian dual-national charged in both the District of New Jersey and Eastern District of Virginia with leading international computer hacking and wire fraud schemes made his initial appearance in Newark, New Jersey, today after being extradited from Poland.</p><p>As alleged in court documents unsealed today, Maksim Silnikau, also known as Maksym Silnikov, 38, led two multiyear cybercrime schemes. At different points, Silnikau has been associated with the online monikers \u201cJ.P. Morgan,\u201d \u201cxxx,\u201d and \u201clansky,\u201d among others.</p><p>In the District of New Jersey, Silnikau, along with alleged co-conspirators Volodymyr Kadariya, a Belarussian and Ukrainian national, 38, and Andrei Tarasov, a Russian national, 33, are charged with cybercrime offenses associated with a scheme to transmit the Angler Exploit Kit, other malware, and online scams to the computers of millions of unsuspecting victim internet users through online advertisements \u2014 so-called \u201cmalvertising\u201d \u2014 and other means from October 2013 through March 2022. In the Eastern District of Virginia, Silnikau is charged for his role as the creator and administrator of the Ransom Cartel ransomware strain and associated ransomware operations beginning in May 2021.</p><p>\u201cToday, the Justice Department takes another step forward in disrupting ransomware actors and malicious cybercriminals who prey on victims in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cAs alleged, for over a decade, the defendant used a host of online disguises and a network of fraudulent ad campaigns to spread ransomware and scam U.S. businesses and consumers. Now, thanks to the hard work of federal agents and prosecutors, along with Polish law enforcement colleagues, Maksim Silnikau must answer these grave charges in an American courtroom.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis arrest underscores a long-term investigation by the U.S. Secret Service, in coordination with foreign, domestic and private partners, of cybercrime organizations that allegedly distributed the notorious Angler Exploit Kit, conducted malvertising, and operated the Ransom Cartel ransomware organization,\u201d said Assistant Director of Investigations Brian Lambert of the U.S. Secret Service. \u201cCybercriminals should know that even if they attempt to hide their criminal conduct behind the anonymity of the internet that eventually, through the dedication of international law enforcement professionals, they will be apprehended and held accountable for their actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilnikau and his co-conspirators allegedly used malware and various online scams to target millions of unsuspecting internet users in the United States and around the world,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cThey hid behind online aliases and engaged in complex, far-reaching cyber fraud schemes to compromise victim devices and steal sensitive personal information. The FBI will continue to work with partners to aggressively impose costs on cybercriminals and hold them accountable for their actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Silnikau and his co-conspirators distributed online advertisements to millions of internet users for the purpose of delivering malicious content,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese ads appeared legitimate but were actually designed to deliver malware that would compromise users\u2019 devices or to deliver \u2018scareware\u2019 designed to trick users into providing their sensitive personal information. Silnikau\u2019s arrest and extradition demonstrate that, working with its domestic and international partners, the Criminal Division is committed to bringing cybercriminals who target U.S. victims to justice, no matter where they are located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese conspirators are alleged to have operated a multiyear scheme to distribute malware onto the computers of millions of unsuspecting internet users around the globe,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cTo carry out the scheme, they used malicious advertising, or \u2018malvertising\u2019, to trick victims into clicking on legitimate-seeming internet ads. Instead, the victims would be redirected to malicious internet sites that delivered malware to their devices, giving the conspirators access to the victims\u2019 personal information. The conspirators then sold that access and information to other cybercriminals on the dark net. Throughout the scheme, the conspirators attempted to hide their identities from law enforcement, including by using fraudulent aliases and online personas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis case reemphasizes the importance of both cybersecurity and our crucial law enforcement partnerships worldwide,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cOnline threats emerge within the digital ecosystem among those who exploit the very tools that help us connect and collaborate. In turn, we must maximize our investigative collaborations globally to address those threats. This investigation demonstrates the positive results of leveraging international partnerships to combat international crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI will continue to work alongside our partners both overseas and in the states to identify and dismantle cyber threats, and to pursue those criminals who attempt to target and defraud victims in the United States,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Stephen Cyrus of the FBI Kansas City Field Office.</p><p><u>District of New Jersey Indictment</u></p><p>According to the indictment unsealed in the District of New Jersey, from October 2013 through March 2022, Silnikau, Kadariya, Tarasov, and others in Ukraine and elsewhere used malvertising and other means to deliver malware, scareware, and online scams to millions of unsuspecting Internet users in the United States and elsewhere. The malvertising campaigns were designed to appear legitimate, but often redirected victim Internet users who viewed or accessed the advertisements to malicious sites and servers that sought to defraud the users or delivered malware to the users\u2019 devices. The conspirators\u2019 scheme caused unsuspecting Internet users to be forcibly redirected to malicious content on millions of occasions, and defrauded and attempted to defraud various U.S.-based companies involved in the sale and distribution of legitimate online advertisements.</p><p>One strain of malware that Silnikau and others allegedly took a leading role in disseminating was the Angler Exploit Kit, which targeted web-based vulnerabilities in Internet browsers and associated plug-ins. At times during the scheme, the Angler Exploit Kit was a leading vehicle through which cybercriminals delivered malware onto compromised electronic devices. The conspirators also allegedly enabled the delivery of \u201cscareware\u201d ads that displayed false messages claiming to have identified a virus or other issue with a victim Internet user\u2019s device. The messages then attempted to deceive the victim into buying or downloading dangerous software, providing remote access to the device, or disclosing personal identifying or financial information.</p><p>For years, the conspirators tricked advertising companies into delivering their malvertising campaigns by using dozens of online personas and fictitious entities to pose as legitimate advertising companies. They also developed and used sophisticated technologies and computer code to refine their malvertisements, malware, and computer infrastructure so as to conceal the malicious nature of their advertising. \u00a0</p><p>As alleged, Silnikau, Kadariya, Tarasov, and conspirators used multiple strategies to profit from their widespread hacking and wire fraud scheme, including by using accounts on predominantly Russian cybercrime forums to sell to cybercriminals access to the compromised devices of victim Internet users (so-called \u201cloads\u201d or \u201cbots\u201d), as well as information stolen from victims and recorded in \u201clogs,\u201d such as banking information and login credentials, to enable further efforts to defraud the victim Internet users or deliver additional malware to their devices.</p><p><u>Eastern District of Virginia Indictment</u></p><p>According to the indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia, Silnikau was the creator and administrator of the Ransom Cartel ransomware strain, created in 2021. Silnikau allegedly had been a member of Russian-speaking cybercrime forums since at least 2005 and was a member of the notorious cybercrime website Direct Connection from 2011 to 2016, when the site was shuttered after the arrest of its administrator.</p><p>Beginning in May 2021, Silnikau allegedly developed a ransomware operation and began recruiting participants from cybercrime forums. On various occasions, Silnikau allegedly distributed information and tools to Ransom Cartel participants, including information about compromised computers, such as stolen credentials, and tools such as those designed to encrypt or \u201clock\u201d compromised computers. Silnikau also allegedly established and maintained a hidden website where he and his co-conspirators could monitor and control ransomware attacks; communicate with each other; communicate with victims, including sending and negotiating payment demands; and manage distribution of funds between co-conspirators.</p><p>On Nov. 16, 2021, Silnikau allegedly executed a ransomware attack on a company based in New York, and on March 5, 2022, Ransom Cartel ransomware was deployed against a company based in California. The hackers removed confidential data without authorization and demanded a monetary payment to refrain from releasing the victim\u2019s data.</p><p>In the District of New Jersey, Silnikau, Kadariya, and Tarasov are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud, and two counts of substantive wire fraud. If convicted, Silnikau, Kadariya, and Tarasov face maximum penalties of 27 years in prison for wire fraud conspiracy, 10 years in prison for computer fraud conspiracy, counts, and 20 years in prison on each wire fraud count.</p><p>In the Eastern District of Virginia, Silnikau is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, and two counts each of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He faces a mandatory minimum of two years in prison and a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p><p>The U.S. Department of State has also announced a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reward-for-information-volodymyr-kadariya/\">reward</a> of up to $2.5 million through its Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of Kadariya. Information that may be eligible for the reward can be submitted by email at <a href=\"mailto:MostWanted@usss.dhs.gov\">MostWanted@usss.dhs.gov</a>.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The U.S. Secret Service and FBI Kansas City Field Office are investigating the case in the District of New Jersey, and the U.S. Secret Service is investigating the case in the Eastern District of Virginia. The Department also appreciates the extensive cooperation and coordination by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and Crown Prosecution Service over the course of several years, as well as significant support provided by the Security Service of Ukraine Cyber Department and Prosecutor General\u2019s Office; Guardia Civil of Spain, Spanish Ministry of Justice, and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Audiencia Nacional; Policia Judiciaria of Portugal; Germany\u2014Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) and Landeskriminalamt (LKA) Berlin; and Polish authorities, in particular assistance provided by Poland\u2019s Central Cybercrime Bureau, Border Guard, Ministry of Justice, and National Prosecutors Office.</p><p>Senior Counsel Aarash A. Haghighat, Cyber Operations International Liaison Louisa K. Becker, and Trial Attorney Christen Gallagher of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Samantha Fasanello, Chief of the Narcotics/OCDETF Unit, for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting Silnikau and his co-defendants in the District of New Jersey. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, Chief of the General Crimes Unit, for New Jersey, and Christopher Oakley for the District of Kansas also provided substantial assistance to the New Jersey case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan Keim and Zoe Bedell are prosecuting the case in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in the extradition of Silnikau and collection of evidence.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Knoot allegedly assisted them in using a stolen identity to pose as a U.S. citizen; hosted company laptops at his residences; downloaded and installed software without authorization on such laptops to facilitate access and perpetuate the deception; and conspired to launder payments for the remote IT work, including to accounts tied to North Korean and Chinese actors.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, this defendant facilitated a scheme to deceive U.S. companies into hiring foreign remote IT workers who were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in income funneled to the DPRK for its weapons program,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThis indictment should serve as a stark warning to U.S. businesses that employ remote IT workers of the growing threat from the DPRK and the need to be vigilant in their hiring processes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNorth Korea has dispatched thousands of highly skilled information technology workers around the world to dupe unwitting businesses and evade international sanctions so that it can continue to fund its dangerous weapons program,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Henry C. Leventis for the Middle District of Tennessee. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment, charging the defendant with facilitating a complex, multi-year scheme that funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to foreign actors, is the most recent example of our office\u2019s commitment to protecting the United States\u2019 national security interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs today\u2019s charges demonstrate, the FBI will relentlessly pursue those who aid the North Korean government\u2019s illegal efforts to generate revenue,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWhere illicit proceeds may be used to fund the regime\u2019s kinetic capacity, we will prioritize our work to disrupt that flow of money. This indictment should demonstrate the risk faced by those who support the DPRK's malicious cyber activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>The DPRK has dispatched thousands of skilled IT workers to live abroad, primarily in China and Russia, with the aim of deceiving U.S. and other businesses worldwide into hiring them as freelance IT workers to generate revenue for its WMD programs. DPRK IT worker schemes involve the use of pseudonymous email, social media, payment platform and online job site accounts, as well as false websites, proxy computers, and witting and unwitting third parties located in the United States and elsewhere. As described in a May 2022 tri-seal <a href=\"https://vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fofac.treasury.gov%2Fmedia%2F923126%2Fdownload%3Finline=%26utm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/0100019132b9dec0-e6e1a030-67f5-495c-aa5c-c986aa014a46-000000/JswUhwRSorJrV8dEK3p7-XLQT64=386\">public service advisory</a> released by the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State, such IT workers have been known to individually earn up to $300,000 annually, generating hundreds of millions of dollars collectively each year, on behalf of designated entities, such as the North Korean Ministry of Defense and others directly involved in the DPRK\u2019s UN-prohibited WMD programs.</p>\n<p>The indictment unsealed today in the Middle District of Tennessee alleges that Knoot participated in a scheme to assist overseas IT workers to obtain remote IT work at U.S. companies which believed that they were hiring U.S.-based personnel. The IT workers, who were North Korean nationals, used the stolen identity of a U.S. citizen, \u201cAndrew M.,\u201d to obtain this remote IT work. The scheme defrauded U.S. media, technology, and financial companies, ultimately causing them hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Knoot ran a \u201claptop farm\u201d at his Nashville residences between approximately July 2022 and August 2023.\u00a0 The victim companies shipped laptops addressed to \u201cAndrew M.\u201d to Knoot\u2019s residences. Following receipt of the laptops, and without authorization, Knoot logged on to the laptops, downloaded and installed unauthorized remote desktop applications, and accessed the victim companies\u2019 networks, causing damage to the computers. The remote desktop applications enabled the North Korean IT workers to work from locations in China, while appearing to the victim companies that \u201cAndrew M.\u201d was working from Knoot\u2019s residences in Nashville. For his participation in the scheme, Knoot was paid a monthly fee for his services by a foreign-based facilitator who went by the name Yang Di. A court-authorized search of Knoot\u2019s laptop farm was executed in early August 2023.</p>\n<p>The overseas IT workers associated with Knoot\u2019s cell were each paid over $250,000 for their work between approximately July 2022 and August 2023, much of which was falsely reported to the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration in the name of the actual U.S. person, Andrew M., whose identity was stolen.\u00a0Knoot and his conspirators\u2019 actions also caused the victim companies more than $500,000 in costs associated with auditing and remediating their devices, systems, and networks.\u00a0Knoot, Di, and others conspired to commit money laundering by conducting financial transactions to receive payments from the victim companies, transfer those funds to Knoot and to accounts outside of the United States, in an attempt both to promote their unlawful activity and to hide that transferred funds were the proceeds of it.\u00a0 The non-U.S. accounts include accounts associated with North Korean and Chinese actors.</p>\n<p>Knoot is charged with conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, intentional damage to protected computers, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to cause the unlawful employment of aliens. If convicted, Knoot faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, including a mandatory minimum of two years in prison on the aggravated identity theft count.</p>\n<p>Under the Department-wide \u201cDPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative,\u201d launched in March 2024 by the National Security Division and the FBI\u2019s Cyber and Counterintelligence Divisions, Department prosecutors and agents are prioritizing the identification and shuttering of U.S.-based \u201claptop farms\u201d \u2014 locations hosting laptops provided by victim U.S. companies to individuals they believed were legitimate U.S.-based freelance IT workers \u2014 and the investigation and prosecution of individuals hosting them.

Following their initial appearance yesterday, the court ordered the three men detained pending trial.\u00a0 The extradition of Parra Arias, Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez follows that of their co-conspirators Rafael Ambiorix Rodriguez Guzman, also known as Max Morgan, 59, and Felix Samuel Reynoso Ventura, also known as Fili and Filly the Kid, 37, who appeared in Newark federal court on July 22 to answer the indictment.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Parra Arias, Vasquez, Dilone Rodriguez and their co-conspirators engaged in a long-running \u201cgrandparent\u201d or \u201cfamily in need of bail\u201d scam against hundreds of seniors across the United States, including in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Parra Arias is alleged to have led a network of call centers in Santiago, Dominican Republic, while Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez worked in these centers to recruit co-conspirators in the United States.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As detailed in court filings, members of the conspiracy referred to as \u201copeners\u201d called elderly victims in the United States and impersonated the victims\u2019 children, grandchildren or other close relatives. The call centers used technology to make it appear that the calls were coming from inside the United States. Typically, the victim was told that their grandchild had been in a car accident, was arrested in connection with an accident, and needed help.</p>\n<p>Once openers tricked victims into believing their loved ones were in dire trouble, others working at the call centers, known as \u201cclosers,\u201d allegedly impersonated defense attorneys, police officers or court personnel and convinced victims to provide thousands of dollars in cash to help their loved ones. The cash was typically retrieved by couriers \u2014 including those recruited and dispatched by Parra Arias, Vasquez, and Dilone Rodriguez \u2014 from the victims\u2019 homes, or mailed by victims at the direction of the closers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and its law enforcement partners will vigorously pursue criminals who defraud victims through so-called \u2018grandparent scams,\u2019\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cWe will continue to identify perpetrators of these schemes and prioritize the pursuit of those who deliberately target vulnerable Americans from abroad. We thank the government of the Dominican Republic for extraditing these defendants to the United States to face charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, these three defendants played a role in a scheme that relied on the love and devotion of elderly victims in order to cheat them out of millions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cIn this \u2018grandparents\u2019 scam,\u2019 some of the defendants allegedly impersonated grandchildren in distress, claiming, for example, they had been arrested after a car accident involving a pregnant woman who later miscarried, and they needed immediate cash for bail or a lawyer. Conspirators like Parra Arias, Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez allegedly operated the call centers or dispatched couriers to pick up money from the victims. My office is committed to protecting the rights of all victims, and we will relentlessly prosecute those who allegedly target vulnerable seniors to steal their hard-earned savings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants and their co-conspirators are accused of heartlessly robbing countless elderly victims of their precious time and often their life savings \u2013 all from more than 1,500 miles away,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. \u201cParra Arias, Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez were among the 16 individuals charged in this appalling scheme, which spanned at least four U.S. states and allegedly threatened hundreds of innocent Americans\u2019 livelihoods. The merciless greed of perpetrators is boundless, but is no match for HSI New York\u2019s El Dorado Task Force, its Cyber Intrusion Group and the greater law enforcement community. I am proud to stand alongside our global partners in our relentless commitment to the safety and overall wellbeing of the vulnerable public.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe grandparent scam is a cruel fraud scheme that deliberately preys on elderly and vulnerable persons within society. Perpetrators, often cowardly operating off-shore, cause extreme emotional and financial harm to the innocent people they target in commission of this crime,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley Parker of the Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General (SSA-OIG) Boston New York Field Division. \u201cSSA-OIG proudly joined HSI, the FBI, the Justice Department and the NYPD in investigating these complex, international scams aimed at defrauding SSA beneficiaries and we appreciate the diligence of the U.S. Marshals Service in facilitating the extradition of these defendants from the Dominican Republic to New Jersey to hold them accountable for their actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are now one step closer to holding accountable the alleged fraudsters who financially exploited hundreds of elderly Americans,\u201d said Commissioner Edward A. Caban of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). \u201cThis should serve as a reminder to other criminals about the extensive reach of New York law enforcement and our unwavering commitment to delivering justice to all victims. I applaud our NYPD investigators and all of our federal partners for their dedication to this important case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Parra Arias, Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez each face multiple charges, including mail and wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count, a maximum fine of $250,000 for each count of mail and wire fraud and a maximum fine of $500,000 for money laundering conspiracy and money laundering.</p>\n<p>HSI, SSA-OIG, NYPD and the FBI are investigating the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrest and extradition from the Dominican Republic of the defendants with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service. Justice Department officials also recognized the critical cooperation of the Dominican government in effecting the extradition of Parra Arias, Vasquez and Dilone Rodriguez pursuant to the treaty between the two countries.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jason Feldman, Joshua Ferrentino and Emily Powers of the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Silane for the District of Jersey are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311). This Justice Department hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, can provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim and identifying relevant next steps. Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis. Reporting is the first step. Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses. The hotline is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET. English, Spanish and other languages are available.</p>\n<p>More information about the department\u2019s efforts to help American seniors is available at its Elder Justice Initiative webpage.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A federal grand jury in the Central District of California returned an indictment yesterday charging a prominent activist short seller with multiple counts of securities fraud for a long-running market manipulation scheme reaping profits of at least $16 million.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Andrew Left, 54, formerly of Beverly Hills, California, and now a resident of Boca Raton, Florida, was a securities analyst, trader, and frequent guest commentator on cable news channels such as CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg Television. Left conducted business under the name \u201cCitron Research\u201d (Citron), an online moniker he created as a vehicle for publishing investment recommendations. Citron\u2019s online presence included a website and a social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Left commented on publicly traded companies, asserting that the market incorrectly valued a company\u2019s stock and advocating that the current price was too high or too low. Left\u2019s recommendations often included an explicit or implicit representation about Citron\u2019s trading position\u2014which created the false pretense that Left\u2019s economic incentives aligned with his public recommendation\u2014and a \u201ctarget price,\u201d which Left represented as his valuation of the company\u2019s stock. Sometimes, the commentary represented Left\u2019s own work. Other times, Left disseminated the commentary of third parties as his own. The commentary routinely included sensationalized headlines and exaggerated language to maximize the reaction it would get from the stock market. As alleged, Left knowingly exploited his ability to move stock prices by targeting stocks popular with retail investors and posting recommendations on social media to manipulate the market and make fast, easy money.</p>\n<p>As further alleged in the indictment, in the leadup to publication of Citron\u2019s commentary, Left established long or short positions in the public company on which he was commenting in his trading accounts and prepared to quickly close those positions post-publication and take profits on the short-term price movement caused by his commentary. Left allegedly used his advance knowledge and control over the timing of a market-moving event to build his positions using inexpensive, short-dated options contracts that expired from the same day that he published his commentary to within five days. Left also allegedly submitted limit orders, often prior to publication of his commentary, to close his positions as soon as the company\u2019s shares reached a certain price and at prices vastly different from the target prices that Left recommended to the public. While Left made false representations to the public to bolster his credibility, behind the scenes, Left allegedly took contrary trading positions to reap quick profits off the stocks he either promoted or pilloried through Citron.</p>\n<p>To further the scheme, Left allegedly advanced the false pretense that his investment recommendations were credible because he was independent and free from any financial conflicts of interest. However, Left allegedly concealed Citron\u2019s financial relationships with a hedge fund by fabricating invoices, wiring payments through a third party, and making false and misleading statements to the public about Citron\u2019s relationship with hedge funds. In addition, Left allegedly lied to law enforcement, stating that Citron \u201cnever\u201d exchanged compensation with a hedge fund or coordinated trading with a hedge fund in advance of the issuance of its commentary.</p>\n<p>Through his publishing of research reports, Left gained influence and a public platform on social media and through regular appearances on podcasts and cable news programs. Left allegedly furthered his scheme by misrepresenting his trading positions during media appearances. For example, after denouncing one company as a \u201cfraud\u201d on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money,\u201d Left allegedly falsely claimed to have covered only a \u201csmall size\u201d of his position in the company\u2019s stock when, earlier that same day, he allegedly closed out more than sixty percent of his position.</p>\n<p>Left is charged with one count of engaging in a securities fraud scheme, 17 counts of securities fraud, and one count of making false statements to federal investigators. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison on the securities fraud scheme count, 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count, and five years in prison on the false statements count.</p>\n<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central District of California; Executive Assistant Director Michael A.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to root out sexual assault within the BOP and hold to account those who so egregiously violate their duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>The initial federal indictment against Darrell Wayne Smith, 55, now residing in Florida, was filed April 13, 2023, and charged him with engaging in illegal sexual acts with three female inmates while he was employed at FCI Dublin as a correctional officer. That initial indictment charged 12 counts that alleged 12 acts occurring between May 2019 and May 2021 in which Smith engaged in separate sexual conduct with each of the three inmate victims.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment issued yesterday, which supplants the initial indictment, identifies two additional victims and charges 15 counts against Smith. It charges all 12 counts of sexual abuse that were charged in the initial indictment, and adds two new counts of sexual abuse, each involving one of the two additional victims. Each additional victim is described as being an inmate at FCI Dublin who suffered abusive sexual conduct by Smith while under his custodial and disciplinary control. Smith\u2019s charged sexual conduct is now alleged to have begun as early as August 2016.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment also adds a third new count that alleges a federal civil rights violation by Smith. The civil rights violation arises from aggravated sexual abuse that Smith is alleged to have engaged in against one of the female inmates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFederal prison guards must treat prisoners humanely,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cVictimizing inmates sexually and denying them basic civil rights must end. Yesterday\u2019s superseding indictment demonstrates my office\u2019s commitment to root out such misconduct and prosecute officers who allegedly perpetrate such abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday\u2019s superseding indictment includes three new allegations of sexual assault by Smith, a Correctional Officer at FCI Dublin,\u201d said Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz. \u201cThe 15 charges against Smith allege he sexually abused multiple inmates over several years, including brazen and violent acts. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (DOJ OIG) is committed to aggressively investigating allegations of abuse at FCI Dublin and across the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendant's alleged actions are some of the most shocking and disturbing charges we've seen for a former federal corrections officer,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. \u201cSexual abuse scars everyone who survives it, but can be particularly traumatizing when it's perpetrated by someone in a position of trust or authority. The FBI is steadfast in our commitment to defending the civil rights of everyone and investigating anyone who allegedly violates this fundamental protection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese allegations of sexual abuse are deeply troubling,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp of the FBI San Francisco Field Office. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing civil rights statutes and holding accountable those who abuse their positions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each of the alleged victims is identified in the superseding indictment by initials only and is alleged to have been in official detention and under Smith\u2019s custodial, supervisory, and disciplinary authority at the time of the charged conduct. Each count in the superseding indictment corresponds with one encounter during which Smith allegedly engaged in unlawful sexual acts or contact with one of the victims, except for the newly charged civil rights violation which arises from alleged aggravated sexual abuse also charged in another count.</p>\n<p>Smith is now charged with six counts of sexual abuse of a ward, seven counts of abusive sexual contact, one count of aggravated sexual abuse, and one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.</p>\n<p>Smith\u2019s arraignment on the superseding indictment has not yet been set. However, Smith is currently set to begin jury trial on March 17, 2025, in front of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers for the Northern District of California. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for each count of aggravated sexual abuse and deprivation of rights under color of law. Additionally, Smith faces a statutory maximum penalty of 15 years in prison for each count of sexual abuse of a ward and a maximum penalty of two years in prison for each count of abusive sexual contact. In addition, as part of any sentence, the court may order a term of supervised release, a fine of up to $250,000 for each count, restitution, and additional assessments. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI and DOJ OIG are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Molly Priedeman and Andrew Paulson for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case, with the assistance of Kay Konopaske.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. \u00a0\u00a0</em></p></div>",

Their ransomware attacks prevented victim health care providers from providing full and timely care to patients.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo years ago, the Justice Department disrupted the North Korean group using Maui ransomware to hold hostage U.S. hospitals and health care providers,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cToday\u2019s criminal charges against one of those alleged North Korean operatives demonstrates that we will be relentless against malicious cyber actors targeting our critical infrastructure. This latest action, in collaboration with our partners in the U.S. and overseas, makes clear that we will continue to deploy all the tools at our disposal to disrupt ransomware attacks, hold those responsible to account, and place victims first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRim Jong Hyok and his co-conspirators deployed ransomware to extort U.S. hospitals and health care companies, then laundered the proceeds to help fund North Korea\u2019s illicit activities,\u201d said Deputy Director Paul Abbate of the FBI. \u201cThese unacceptable and unlawful actions placed innocent lives at risk. The FBI and our partners will leverage every tool available to neutralize criminal actors and protect American citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNorth Korean hackers developed custom tools to target and extort U.S. health care providers and used their ill-gotten gains to fund a spree of hacks into government, technology, and defense entities worldwide, all while laundering money through China,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe indictment, seizures, and other actions announced today demonstrate the Department\u2019s resolve to hold these malicious actors accountable, impose costs on the North Korean cyber program, and help innocent network owners recover their losses and defend themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment underscores our commitment to protecting critical infrastructure from malicious actors and the countries that sponsor them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Kate E. Brubacher for the District of Kansas. \u201cRim Jong Hyok and those in his trade put people\u2019s lives in jeopardy. They imperil timely, effective treatment for patients and cost hospitals billions of dollars a year. The Justice Department will continue to disrupt nation-state actors and ensure that American systems are protected in the District of Kansas and across our nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) will continue to work alongside our law enforcement partners to root out malicious actors who seek to degrade the Department of the Air Force\u2019s ability to protect the nation,\u201d said Brigadier General Amy S. Bumgarner, OSI Commander. \u201cMultiple OSI units, including one of our newly established National Security Detachments, which were established to provide counterintelligence, law enforcement and analytical support to protect technology at the earliest stages of advanced research and development, provided support to this investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile North Korea uses these types of cybercrimes to circumvent international sanctions and fund its political and military ambitions, the impact of these wanton acts have a direct impact on the citizens of Kansas,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Stephen A. Cyrus of the FBI Kansas City Field Office. \u201cThese actions keep our families from getting the health care they need, slowing the response of our first responders, endangering our critical infrastructure and, ultimately, costing Kansans through ransoms paid, lost productivity, and money spent to rebuild our networks following cyber attacks. Today\u2019s charges prove these cyber actors cannot act with impunity and that malicious actions against the citizens of Kansas and the rest of the United States have severe consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment of individuals responsible for breaching U.S. government systems, regardless of their location, demonstrates the dedication of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Office of Inspector General (NASA-OIG), the Justice Department, and our law enforcement partners to relentlessly investigate, prosecute, and hold accountable those who believe they can operate in the shadows,\u201d said Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Robert Steinau of NASA-OIG.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Rim and his co-conspirators worked for North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, a military intelligence agency, and are known to the private sector as \u201cAndariel,\u201d \u201cOnyx Sleet,\u201d and \u201cAPT45.\u201d Rim and his co-conspirators laundered ransom payments through China-based facilitators and used these proceeds to purchase internet infrastructure, which the co-conspirators then used to hack and exfiltrate sensitive defense and technology information from entities across the globe. Victims of this further hacking include two U.S. Air Force bases, NASA-OIG, and entities located in Taiwan, South Korea, and China. Related Andariel activity has been the subject of private sector reporting, and a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-207a\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity advisory with updated technical indicators of compromise </a>was published by the FBI, the National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Cyber National Mission Force, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense\u2019s Cyber Crime Center, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration, and South Korean and United Kingdom partners today.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department and the FBI are also announcing the interdiction of approximately $114,000 in virtual currency proceeds of ransomware attacks and related money laundering transactions, as well as the seizure of online accounts used by co-conspirators to carry out their malicious cyber activity. The FBI previously <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-and-forfeits-approximately-500000-north-korean-ransomware-actors\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seized approximately $500,000</a> in virtual currency proceeds of ransomware attacks and related money laundering transactions. In addition to these actions, the Department of State announced today a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-north-korean-malicious-cyber-actor-targeting-u-s-critical-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reward\u00a0offer of up to $10 million for information</a> leading to the location or identification of Rim. The State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice program has a standing reward offer for information leading to the identification or location of any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, engages in certain malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>\n<p>Private sector partners are also taking other voluntary actions to limit the spread of Andariel-created malware. In partnership with the Department, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/07/25/onyx-sleet-uses-array-of-malware-to-gather-intelligence-for-north-korea/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft developed and implemented technical measures to block Andariel actors</a> from accessing victims\u2019 computer networks. Additionally, Mandiant is publishing research today that <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt45-north-korea-digital-military-machine\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highlights its unique insights into Andariel\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures</a>. These actions by Microsoft and Mandiant were a significant part of the overall effort to secure networks, and they will help cybersecurity practitioners prevent, identify, and mitigate attacks from Andariel actors.</p>\n<p><u>Maui Ransomware and Money Laundering</u></p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Rim worked for North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency, and participated in the conspiracy to target and hack computer networks of U.S. hospitals and other health care providers, encrypt their electronic files, extort a ransom payment from them, launder those payments, and use the laundered proceeds to hack targets of interest to the North Korean regime.</p>\n<p>The Andariel actors used custom malware, developed by the RGB, known as \u201cMaui.\u201d After running the maui.exe program to encrypt a ransomware victim\u2019s computer network, the North Korean co-conspirators would extort the organization by leaving a note with a cryptocurrency address for a ransom payment.</p>\n<p>The Andariel actors received ransom payments in a virtual currency and then laundered the payments with the assistance of Hong Kong-based facilitators. In at least one case, these Hong Kong facilitators converted ransom funds from cryptocurrency to Chinese yuan. The yuan was then accessed from an ATM in China in the immediate vicinity of the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, which connects Dandong, China, and Sinuiju, North Korea.</p>\n<p><u>Exfiltration of Sensitive Data from Companies and Government Agencies</u></p>\n<p>Rim and his co-conspirators used ransom proceeds to lease virtual private servers that were used to launch attacks against defense, technology, and other organizations, and to steal information from them. Victims of this further hacking included U.S. defense contractors, two U.S. Air Force bases, NASA-OIG, South Korean and Taiwanese defense contractors, and a Chinese energy company. The Andariel actors obtained initial access to victims\u2019 networks by exploiting known vulnerabilities that had not been patched by the victims, including the widespread Log4Shell vulnerability. (Additional tactics, techniques, and procedures are available in the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-207a\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">joint cybersecurity advisory</a> released today.) The Andariel actors stole terabytes of information, including unclassified U.S. government employee information, old technical information related to military aircraft, intellectual property, and limited technical information pertaining to maritime and uranium processing projects.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan Huschka and Chris Oakley for the District of Kansas and Trial Attorneys Neeraj Gupta and George Brown of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The FBI continues to investigate Andariel\u2019s hacking and money laundering activities. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, and NASA-OIG provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Following their initial appearance yesterday, the court ordered both men detained pending trial.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Rodriguez Guzman, Reynoso Ventura and their co-conspirators engaged in a long-running \u201cgrandparent\u201d or \u201cfamily in need of bail\u201d scam against hundreds of seniors across the United States, including in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Both Rodriguez Guzman and Reynoso Ventura are alleged to have worked in the call centers in the Dominican Republic from which the scam operated, where they phoned elderly Americans and sought to steal their money.</p>\n<p>As detailed in court filings, members of the conspiracy referred to as \u201copeners\u201d called elderly victims in the United States and impersonated the victims\u2019 children, grandchildren or other close relatives. The call centers used technology to make it appear that the calls were coming from inside the United States. Typically, the victim was told that their grandchild had been in a car accident, was arrested in connection with an accident and needed help.</p>\n<p>Once openers tricked victims into believing their loved ones were in dire trouble, others working at the call centers, known as \u201cclosers\u201d \u2014 including Rodriguez Guzman and Reynoso Ventura \u2014 allegedly impersonated defense attorneys, police officers or court personnel and convinced victims to provide thousands of dollars in cash to help their loved ones. The cash was typically retrieved by couriers sent to the victims\u2019 homes or mailed by victims at the direction of the closers.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez Guzman and Reynoso Ventura each face multiple charges, including mail and wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count, a maximum fine of $250,000 for each count of the mail and wire fraud charges and a maximum fine of $500,000 for money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and its law enforcement partners will vigorously pursue criminals who defraud victims through so-called \u2018grandparent scams,\u2019\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cWe will continue to identify perpetrators of these schemes and prioritize the pursuit of those who deliberately target vulnerable Americans from abroad.\u00a0 We thank the government of the Dominican Republic for extraditing these defendants to the United States to face charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, these two defendants played a role in a scheme that relied on the love and devotion of elderly victims in order to cheat them out of millions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cIn this \u2018grandparents\u2019 scam,\u2019 some of the defendants allegedly impersonated grandchildren in distress, claiming, for example, they had been arrested after a car accident involving a pregnant woman who later miscarried, and they needed immediate cash for bail or a lawyer. Conspirators like Rodriguez Guzman and Reynoso Ventura allegedly impersonated a variety of people \u2013 police officers, lawyers and others \u2013 to convince the victims to pay up, which the panic-stricken grandparents often did. My office is committed to protecting the rights of all victims, and we will relentlessly prosecute those who allegedly target vulnerable seniors to steal their hard-earned savings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants and their co-conspirators are accused of heartlessly robbing countless elderly victims of their precious time and often their life savings \u2013 all from more than 1,500 miles away, said Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. \u201cRafael Ambiorix Rodriguez Guzman and Felix Samuel Reynoso Ventura were among the 16 individuals charged in this appalling scheme, which spanned at least four U.S. states and allegedly threatened hundreds of innocent Americans\u2019 livelihoods. The merciless greed of perpetrators is boundless, but is no match for HSI New York\u2019s El Dorado Task Force, its Cyber Intrusion Group and the greater law enforcement community. I am proud to stand alongside our global partners in our relentless commitment to the safety and overall wellbeing of the vulnerable public.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe grandparent scam is a cruel fraud scheme that deliberately preys on elderly and vulnerable persons within society. Perpetrators, often cowardly operating off-shore, cause extreme emotional and financial harm to the innocent people they target in commission of this crime,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley Parker of the Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General (SSA-OIG) Boston New York Field Division. \u201cSSA OIG proudly joined HSI, the FBI, the Justice Department and the NYPD in investigating these complex, international scams aimed at defrauding SSA beneficiaries and we appreciate the diligence of the U.S. Marshals Service in facilitating the extradition of these defendants from the Dominican Republic to New Jersey to hold them accountable for their actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are now one step closer to holding accountable the alleged fraudsters who financially exploited hundreds of elderly Americans,\u201d said Commissioner Edward A. Caban of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). \u201cThis should serve as a reminder to other criminals about the extensive reach of New York law enforcement and our unwavering commitment to delivering justice to all victims. I applaud our NYPD investigators and all of our federal partners for their dedication to this important case.\u201d</p>\n<p>HSI, SSA-OIG, NYPD and the FBI are investigating the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrest and extradition from the Dominican Republic of the defendants with assistance from the United States Marshals Service. Justice Department officials also recognized the critical cooperation of the Dominican government in effecting the extradition of Rodriguez Guzman and Reynoso Ventura pursuant to the treaty between the two countries.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jason Feldman, Joshua Ferrentino and Emily Powers of the Civil Division's Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Silane for the District of Jersey are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Two foreign nationals pleaded guilty today to participating in the LockBit ransomware group\u2014at various times the most prolific ransomware variant in the world\u2014and to deploying LockBit attacks against victims in the United States and worldwide.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s convictions reflect the latest returns on the Department\u2019s investment in disrupting ransomware threats, prioritizing victims, and holding cybercriminals accountable,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cIn executing our all-tools cyber enforcement strategy, we\u2019ve dealt significant blows to destructive ransomware groups like LockBit, as we did earlier this year, seizing control of LockBit infrastructure and distributing decryption keys to their victims. Today\u2019s actions serve as a warning to ransomware actors who would attack Americans: we will find you and hold you accountable.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants committed ransomware attacks against victims in the United States and around the world through LockBit, which was one of the most destructive ransomware groups in the world,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cBut thanks to the work of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, along with its domestic and international partners, LockBit no longer claims that title. Today\u2019s convictions represent another important milestone in the Criminal Division\u2019s ongoing effort to disrupt and dismantle ransomware groups, protect victims, and bring cybercriminals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov (\u0410\u0421\u0422\u0410\u041c\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u041c\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c), 21, a Russian national of the Chechen Republic, Russia, and Mikhail Vasiliev, 34, a dual Canadian and Russian national of Bradford, Ontario, were members of LockBit. In the period between January 2020 and February 2024, LockBit grew into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. LockBit attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries, including 1,800 victims in the United States. Those victims included individuals, small businesses, multinational corporations, hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit\u2019s members extorted at least approximately $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in additional losses to victims, including costs like lost revenue and for incident response and recovery.</p>\n<p>LockBit\u2019s \u201caffiliate\u201d members, including Vasiliev and Astamirov, first identified and unlawfully accessed vulnerable computer systems, and then deployed LockBit ransomware on those systems to both steal and encrypt stored data. When LockBit attacks were successful, LockBit\u2019s affiliate members then demanded ransoms from their victims in exchange for decrypting the victims\u2019 data and then claiming to delete the affiliates\u2019 copies of the data. When victims did not pay the demanded ransoms, LockBit\u2019s affiliates often left the victim\u2019s data permanently encrypted and publish the stolen data, including highly sensitive information, on a publicly accessible internet site under LockBit\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstamirov and Vasiliev thought that they could deploy LockBit from the shadows, wreaking havoc and pocketing massive ransom payments from their victims, without consequence,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThey were wrong. We, in New Jersey, along with our domestic and international law enforcement partners will do everything in our power to hold LockBit\u2019s members and other cybercriminals accountable, disrupt and dismantle their operations, and put a spotlight on them as wanted criminals\u2014no matter where they hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstamirov and Vasiliev were members of the LockBit ransomware group, which has caused severe harm around the globe by attacking computer systems in over a hundred countries damaging organizations ranging from government and law-enforcement agencies to hospitals and schools,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cToday\u2019s plea shows our relentless and unwavering commitment to ensuring that cyber criminals are brought to justice for their actions. The FBI is proud of the international collaboration that led to these individuals being held accountable under the law for the damage their actions have caused.\u201d</p>\n<p>Between 2020 and 2023, Astamirov deployed LockBit against at least 12 victims, including businesses in Virginia, Japan, France, Scotland, and Kenya. Operating under the online aliases \u201cBETTERPAY,\u201d \u201cofftitan,\u201d and \u201cEastfarmer,\u201d he extorted $1.9 million from those victims. As part of his plea agreement, Astamirov agreed to forfeit, among other assets, $350,000 in seized cryptocurrency that he extorted from one of his LockBit victims. Astamirov was first <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-arrested-and-charged-conspiring-commit-lockbit-ransomware-attacks-against-us\">charged and arrested</a> in this matter in June 2023.</p>\n<p>Between 2021 and 2023, Vasiliev, operating under the online aliases \u201cGhostrider,\u201d \u201cFree,\u201d \u201cDigitalocean90,\u201d \u201cDigitalocean99,\u201d \u201cDigitalwaters99,\u201d and \u201cNewwave110,\u201d deployed LockBit against at least 12 victims, including businesses in New Jersey, Michigan, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. He also deployed LockBit against an educational facility in England and a school in Switzerland. Through these attacks, Vasiliev caused at least $500,000 in damage and losses to his victims. Vasiliev was first <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-participation-lockbit-global-ransomware-campaign\">charged</a> in this matter and arrested in Canada by Canadian authorities in November 2022, and extradited to the United States in June.</p>\n<p>Astamirov pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. Vasiliev pleaded guilty to a four-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intentional damage to a protected computer, transmission of a threat in relation to damaging a protected computer, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p><u>The LockBit Investigation</u></p>\n<p>Today\u2019s guilty pleas follow a recent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">disruption</a>\u00a0of LockBit ransomware in February by the U.K. National Crime Agency\u2019s (NCA) Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization\u2019s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. This disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit\u2019s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by documents filed in this case.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s guilty pleas also follow prior announcements of charges brought in the District of New Jersey against four other LockBit members, including its alleged creator, developer, and administrator, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. According to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware\">an indictment</a> unsealed in May, Khoroshev allegedly acted as the group\u2019s administrator from as early as September 2019 through 2024. In that role, \u00a0Khoroshev recruited new affiliate members, spoke for the group publicly under the alias \u201cLockBitSupp,\u201d and developed and maintained the infrastructure used by affiliates to deploy LockBit attacks. Khoroshev also took 20% of each ransom paid by LockBit victims, allowing him to personally derive at least $100 million over that period. Khoroshev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at https://tips.fbi.gov/home.</p>\n<p>Other charges against LockBit members include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In February 2024, in parallel with the disruption operation, an indictment was unsealed in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev</a>, also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries.</li>\n<li>In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/mikhail-pavlovich-matveev\">Mikhail Matveev</a>, also known as Wazawaka, m1x, Boriselcin, and Uhodiransomwar, with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Matveev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s TOC Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at <a href=\"http://www.tips.fbi.gov/\">tips.fbi.gov/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The U.S. Department of State\u2019s TOC Rewards Program is also offering rewards of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and location of any individuals who hold a key leadership position in LockBit; and</li>\n<li>Up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual participating or attempting to participate in LockBit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information is accepted through the FBI tip website at <a href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/\">www.tips.fbi.gov</a>/.</p>\n<p>Khoroshev, Matveev, Sungatov, and Kondratyev have also been designated for sanctions by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control for their roles in launching cyberattacks.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><u>Victim Assistance</u></p>\n<p>LockBit victims are encouraged to contact the FBI and submit information at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/</a>. As announced by the Department in February, law enforcement, through its disruption efforts, has developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Submitting information at the IC3 site will enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted.</p>\n<p>LockBit victims are also encouraged to visit <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/lockbit\">www.justice.gov/usao-nj/lockbit</a> for case updates and information regarding their rights under U.S. law, including the right to submit victim impact statements and request restitution, in the litigation against Astamirov and Vasiliev.</p>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office, under the supervision of Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy, is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant. The FBI Atlanta Field Office, under the supervision of Special Agent in Charge Keri Farley; U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia; Ontario Provincial Police in Ontario, Canada; and Crown Attorney\u2019s Office in Toronto, Canada, provided significant assistance in the Vasiliev matter. The United Kingdom\u2019s NCA; France\u2019s\u00a0 Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command and Cyber Division of the Paris Prosecution Office; Germany\u2019s Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein and the Bundeskriminalamt; Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Justice and Police, Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office for the Canton of Zurich, and Zurich Cantonal Police; Japan\u2019s National Policy Agency; Australian Federal Police; Sweden\u2019s Polismyndighetens; Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Politie Dienst Regionale Recherche Oost-Brabant of the Netherlands; Finland\u2019s Poliisi; Europol; and Eurojust have provided significant assistance and coordination in both matters and in the LockBit investigation generally.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck, Debra Ireland, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the charges against Astamirov and Vasiliev.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, Office of International Affairs, and National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Additional details on protecting networks against LockBit ransomware are available at StopRansomware.gov.

Later targets included computer systems in countries that were providing support to Ukraine, including the United States. Stigal remains at large.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, the defendant conspired with Russian military intelligence on the eve of Russia\u2019s unjust and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine to launch cyberattacks targeting the Ukrainian government and later targeting its allies, including the United States.\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to stand with Ukraine on every front in its fight against Russia\u2019s war of aggression, including by holding accountable those who support Russia\u2019s malicious cyber activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe GRU has repeatedly applied in cyberspace Russia\u2019s statecraft of indiscriminate destruction and intimidation,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen. \u201cThe Department will do its part to prevent and disrupt such malicious behavior that relies upon online services or infrastructure in the U.S., or that targets U.S. victims. We will also identify, pursue, and eventually hold to account those responsible for Russia\u2019s malicious actions, including the cybercriminals that the Russian government cultivates in furtherance of its malign agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmin Timovich Stigal attempted to leverage malware to aid the Russian military in the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the FBI\u2019s unwavering commitment to combat malicious cyber activities by our adversaries, and we will continue to work with our international partners to thwart attempts to undermine and harm our allies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalicious cyber actors who attack our allies should know that we will pursue them to the full extent of the law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. \u201cCyber intrusion schemes such as the one alleged threaten our national security, and we will use all the technologies and investigative measures at our disposal to disrupt and track down these cybercriminals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment of Amin Stigal is yet another example of the FBI\u2019s commitment to combating cyber threats both at home and internationally,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. \u201cTo those adversaries who seek to compromise our international partners\u2019 systems, know you will be identified and you will face consequences for your actions. The FBI vows to continually pursue justice and disrupt malicious cyber actors.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, in Jan. 2022, Stigal and members of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) of the Russian Federation (the Conspirators) conspired to use a U.S.-based company\u2019s services to distribute malware known in the cybersecurity community as \u201cWhisperGate\u201d to dozens of Ukrainian government entities\u2019 computer systems and destroy those systems and related data in advance of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The United States government previously joined with allies and partners in May 2022 to attribute this cyber-attack to the Russian military and to condemn the attack and similar destructive cyber activities against Ukraine.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 13, 2022, the Conspirators attacked multiple Ukrainian government networks, including the Ukrainian Ministry of International Affairs, the State Treasury, the Judiciary Administration, the State Portal for Digital Services, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection, the Ministry of Energy, the Accounting Chamber for Ukraine, the State Emergency Service, the State Forestry Agency, and the Motor Insurance Bureau. The Conspirators infected computers on these and other networks with malware called WhisperGate, which was designed to look like ransomware. However, as the indictment alleges, WhisperGate was actually a cyberweapon designed to completely destroy the target computer and related data.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with these attacks, the Conspirators compromised several of the targeted Ukrainian computer systems, exfiltrated sensitive data, including patient health records, and defaced the websites to read: \u201cUkrainians! All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.\u201d That same day, the Conspirators offered the hacked data for sale on the internet. The effort was aimed at sowing concern among the broader Ukrainian population regarding the safety of government systems and data.</p>\n<p>In August 2022, the Conspirators also hacked the transportation infrastructure of a Central European country that was supporting Ukraine. The indictment further alleges that from Aug. 5, 2021, through Feb. 3, 2022, the Conspirators leveraged the same computer infrastructure they used in the Ukraine-related attacks to probe computers belonging to a federal government agency in Maryland in the same manner as they had initially probed the Ukrainian Government networks.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Stigal faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Baltimore Field Office is investigating the case with the support of the FBI\u2019s Milwaukee and Boston Field Offices.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron S.J. Zelinsky and Robert I. Goldaris for the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Julian P. Assange, 52, the founder of WikiLeaks, pleaded guilty today to conspiring with Chelsea Manning, at that time a U.S. Army intelligence analyst, to unlawfully obtain and disclose classified documents relating to the national defense. After obtaining classified national defense information from Manning, and aware of the harm that dissemination of such national defense information would cause, Assange disclosed this information on WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>The guilty plea concludes a criminal matter that dates back to March 2018, when Assange was first indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia. There, and in superseding indictments, Assange was charged with conspiring with Manning, then a \u201cTop Secret\u201d U.S. security clearance holder, to further Manning\u2019s unlawful acquisition and transmission of bulk classified information, including Manning\u2019s use of a government computer to illegally download hundreds of thousands of classified documents and transmit them without authorization to WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>Assange was detained in the United Kingdom based on the U.S. charges for the last 62 months, while he contested extradition. As part of the plea agreement, Assange was transported to the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to enter his felony guilty plea and be sentenced on the morning of June 26 (Saipan local time) in a U.S. courtroom, with the venue reflecting Assange\u2019s opposition to traveling to the continental United States to enter his guilty plea and the proximity of this federal U.S. District Court to Assange\u2019s country of citizenship, Australia, to which he will return. At today\u2019s proceeding, Assange admitted to his role in the conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act and received a court-imposed 62-month time-served sentence, reflecting the time he served in U.K. prison as a result of the U.S. charges. Following the imposition of sentence, he will depart the United States for his native Australia. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Assange is prohibited from returning to the United States without permission.</p>\n<p>Beginning in late 2009, Assange and WikiLeaks actively solicited United States classified information, including by publishing a list of \u201cMost Wanted Leaks\u201d that sought, among other things, bulk classified documents. As set forth in the public charging documents, Assange actively solicited and recruited people who had access, authorized or otherwise, to classified information and were willing to provide that information to him and WikiLeaks\u2014and also solicited hackers who could obtain unauthorized access to classified information through computer network intrusions. Assange publicly encouraged his prospective recruits to obtain the information he desired by any means necessary, including hacking and theft, and to send that information to Assange at WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>Between January 2010 and May 2010, in the course of the conspiracy with Assange, Manning used U.S. government computer systems to download hundreds of thousands of documents and reports, many of them classified at the SECRET level and relating to the national defense, which signified that unauthorized disclosure could cause serious damage to United States national security. In total, Manning downloaded four nearly complete U.S. government databases that contained, among other things, approximately 90,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related significant activity reports, 800 Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF GTMO) detainee assessment briefs, and 250,000 U.S. Department of State cables. Manning also downloaded files regarding rules of engagement in the Iraq war, most of which were classified at the SECRET level and which delineated the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces would initiate or conduct combat engagement with other forces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After downloading digital reams of classified documents and files, Manning electronically sent them to Assange to be publicly posted on WikiLeaks\u2019s website. During Manning\u2019s bulk exfiltration and passage of classified materials to WikiLeaks, Manning and Assange communicated regularly via online platforms about Manning\u2019s progress and what classified information Assange wanted. For example, after sending the classified JTF GTMO detainee assessment briefs to Assange, Manning told Assange \u201cthats [sic] all I really have got left.\u201d To encourage Manning to continue to take classified documents from the United States and provide them to Assange and WikiLeaks without authorization, Assange replied, \u201ccurious eyes never run dry in my experience.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In or about 2010 and 2011, Assange publicly disclosed via the WikiLeaks website hundreds of thousands of documents that Manning had taken without authorization and given to him, including approximately 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports, classified up to the Secret level; 400,000 Iraq war-related significant activity reports, classified up to the Secret level; 800 JTF GTMO detainee assessment briefs, classified up to the Secret level; and over 100,000 State Department cables, some of which were classified up to the Secret level.</p>\n<p>Unlike news organizations that published redacted versions of some of the classified documents that Assange obtained from Manning and then shared with those organizations, Assange and WikiLeaks disclosed many of the raw classified documents without removing any personally identifying information. Specifically, in many instances, the classified documents Manning unlawfully provided to Assange were later released publicly by Assange and WikiLeaks in a raw or unredacted form that placed individuals who had assisted the U.S. government at great personal risk. Assange\u2019s decision to reveal the names of human sources illegally shared with him by Manning created a grave and imminent risk to human life. For example, the State Department cables that WikiLeaks disseminated included information from journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who had chosen to provide information to the United States in confidence at significant risk to their own safety. By publicly releasing these documents without redacting the names of human sources or other identifying information, Assange subjected these individuals to serious harm and arbitrary detention. Assange even acknowledged in public statements that he knew that publicly disclosing unredacted classified documents containing the names and other identifying information of people who had shared information with the U.S. government in confidence could put those people at risk of harm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing Assange\u2019s arrest and in litigating Assange\u2019s extradition. The United Kingdom\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, National Extradition Unit (and its predecessor in the Metropolitan Police Service), and Central Authority also provided significant assistance to the extradition proceedings over the past five years. Logistical support was also provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency\u2019s Joint International Crime Centre, U.K. law enforcement agencies, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>\n<p>The National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES), U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia handled the case. U.S. Attorney Shawn N. Anderson for the District of Guam and NMI, CES Deputy Chief Matthew McKenzie, and National Security Cyber Section Trial Attorney Jacques Singer-Emery represented the United States in the NMI proceedings. CES Trial Attorneys Nicholas Hunter and Adam Small, and Trial Attorney Rachel Yasser and Legal Advisor/International Affairs Coordinator Amanda June Chadwick of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1358631/dl?inline\" title=\"Link to Criminal Information\">Link to Criminal Information</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1358636/dl?inline\" title=\"Link to Plea Agreement\">Link to Plea Agreement</a></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted a Nigerian national today for operating a business email compromise scheme targeting victims in the United States and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Ebuka Raphael Umeti, 35, and his co-conspirators sent victim businesses phishing emails, which were made to appear as though they originated from trusted senders, such as a bank or a vendor. These phishing attacks allowed the co-conspirators to gain unauthorized access to victim computer systems and email accounts, including by infecting victim computers with malicious software or \u201cmalware\u201d that provided the co-conspirators with remote access. The co-conspirators then exploited that access to obtain sensitive information, which they used to deceive individuals at victim companies into executing wire transfers to accounts specified by the co-conspirators. As a result of this scheme, the co-conspirators caused or attempted to cause more than $1.5 million of loss to victims.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmeti participated in a sophisticated computer hacking and business email compromise scheme that targeted numerous businesses in the United States,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cAlthough Umeti and his co-conspirators carried out their scheme from outside the United States, they were not beyond the reach of the Justice Department. Today\u2019s conviction should serve as yet another reminder that, if you target American victims, the Criminal Division is committed to tracking you down and holding you responsible for your criminal conduct, no matter where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reach of cyber criminals is extensive, but so too is the reach of the law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cUmeti relied on hidden malware, deception, and an ocean of distance to steal from American businesses and avoid prosecution. Despite those obstacles and obfuscations, a dedicated team of investigators and prosecutors showed outstanding resolve in bringing him to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdict is a victory in our fight against cybercrime and should serve as a warning to cybercriminals who believe they can operate with impunity,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office. \u201cThe FBI remains committed to relentlessly pursuing those engaged in malicious cyber activities and ensuring they are held accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Umeti of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, three counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer, and intentional damage to a protected computer. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 27 and faces a maximum penalty of 27 years in prison on the wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer count, 20 years on each wire fraud count, and 10 years on the intentional damage to a protected computer count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Co-defendant Franklin Ifeanyichukwu Okwonna, 34, pleaded guilty on May 20 to his role in the scheme and is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 3.</p>\n<p>The FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs worked with the FBI\u2019s Legal Attach\u00e9 Office in Nairobi, the U.S. Marshals Service, and Kenya\u2019s Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and Directorate of Criminal Investigation to secure the extradition of Umeti and his co-defendant.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel Thomas S. Dougherty of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura D. Withers for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case. CCIPS Senior Counsel Aarash Haghighat assisted in the investigation and indictment of the case.</p></div>",

They allegedly devised a plan to provide two co-conspirators\u2019 identity documents to Lang and a fourth co-conspirator, Matthew Scott McCloud, for the purpose of applying for U.S. passports under assumed names. While in North Carolina, Lang allegedly submitted a U.S. passport application in the assumed name of one of his co-conspirators, Dameon Shae Adcock. Approximately two days later, Lang allegedly gave Adcock a suitcase containing multiple firearms, a military smoke grenade, and approximately $1,500 in cash as payment for use of Adcock\u2019s personal information. Several days later, Lang and McCloud, who had applied for a U.S. passport using the identity of co-conspirator Jordan Dean Miller, allegedly acquired airline tickets to travel from Georgia to New York and then on to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) is committed to working with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and other law enforcement agencies around the world to investigate and prosecute all allegations of criminal activity related to identity theft,\u201d said Assistant Director Andrew Wroblewski of DSS Domestic Operations. \u201cThe strong relationship we enjoy with our domestic and overseas law enforcement partners is vital towards ensuring the integrity of U.S. travel documents and protecting greater U.S. interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lang was charged with conspiracy to commit passport fraud and aggravated identify theft, passport fraud, aggravated identity theft, fraud, and misuse of visas, permits, and other documents, and aiding and abetting these offenses, as well as false representation of a social security account number. Adcock, Miller, and McCloud were also charged in connection with the criminal scheme.

These devices were associated with more than 19 million unique IP addresses, including 613,841 IP addresses located in the United States. Wang then generated millions of dollars by offering cybercriminals access to these infected IP addresses for a fee.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Justice Department-led operation brought together law enforcement partners from around the globe to disrupt 911 S5, a botnet that facilitated cyber-attacks, large-scale fraud, child exploitation, harassment, bomb threats, and export violations,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAs a result of this operation, YunHe Wang was arrested on charges that he created and operated the botnet and deployed malware. This case makes clear that the long arm of the law stretches across borders and into the deepest shadows of the dark web, and the Justice Department will never stop fighting to hold cybercriminals to account.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorking with our international partners, the FBI conducted a joint, sequenced cyber operation to dismantle the 911 S5 Botnet\u2014likely the world\u2019s largest botnet ever,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\u00a0 \u201cWe arrested its administrator, Yunhe Wang, seized infrastructure and assets, and levied sanctions against Wang and his co-conspirators. The 911 S5 Botnet infected computers in nearly 200 countries and facilitated a whole host of computer-enabled crimes, including financial frauds, identity theft, and child exploitation. This operation demonstrates the FBI\u2019s commitment to working shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners to protect American businesses and the American people, and we will work tirelessly to unmask and arrest the cybercriminals who profit from this illegal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Wang allegedly propagated his malware through Virtual Private Network (VPN) programs, such as MaskVPN and DewVPN (torrent distribution models that he operated) and pay-per-install services that bundled his malware with other program files, including pirated versions of licensed software or copyrighted materials. Wang then managed and controlled approximately 150 dedicated servers worldwide, approximately 76 of which he leased from U.S. based online service providers. Using the dedicated servers, Wang deployed and managed applications, commanded and controlled the infected devices, operated his 911 S5 service, and provided paying customers with access to proxied IP addresses associated with the infected devices.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Wang created malware that compromised millions of residential computers around the world and then sold access to the infected computers to cybercriminals,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese criminals used the hijacked computers to conceal their identities and commit a host of crimes, from fraud to cyberstalking. Cybercriminals should take note. Today\u2019s announcement sends a clear message that the Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners are firm in their resolve to disrupt the most technologically sophisticated criminal tools and hold wrongdoers to account.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYunHe Wang created and administered a residential proxy service\u2014a botnet known as 911 S5\u2014that affected millions of computers all over the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damien M. Diggs for the Eastern District of Texas. \u201cHe will now be held accountable. Proxy services like 911 S5 are pervasive threats that shield criminals behind the compromised IP addresses of residential computers worldwide. Successfully tackling a problem of this scale is only possible with strong collaboration and exceptional investigative work between our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, and we stand ready to hold accountable anyone\u2014no matter where they are located\u2014who exploits our telecommunications infrastructure for their own criminal purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals then used proxied IP addresses purchased from 911 S5 to conceal their true originating IP addresses and locations, and anonymously commit a wide array of offenses. These offenses including financial crimes, stalking, transmitting bomb threats and threats of harm, illegal exportation of goods, and receiving and sending child exploitation materials. Since 2014, 911 S5 allegedly enabled cybercriminals to bypass financial fraud detection systems and steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs.</p>\n<p>911 S5 customers allegedly targeted certain pandemic relief programs. For example, the United States estimates that 560,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims originated from compromised IP addresses, resulting in a confirmed fraudulent loss exceeding $5.9 billion. Additionally, in evaluating suspected fraud loss to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, the United States estimates that more than 47,000 EIDL applications originated from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5. Millions of dollars more were similarly identified by financial institutions in the United States as loss originating from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5.</p>\n<p>The 911 S5 client interface software, which was hosted on U.S.-based servers, enabled cybercriminals located outside of the United States to purchase goods with stolen credit cards or criminally derived proceeds, and illegally export them outside of the United States contrary to U.S. export laws, such as the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The 911 S5 client interface may also contain encryption or other features which subject it to export controls detailed in the EAR. Accordingly, downloads of the 911 S5 client interface software by certain foreign nationals without a license may constitute violations of the EAR.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe disruption, seizure, and arrest of the perpetrator(s) responsible for the 911 S5 cybercriminal enterprise demonstrates the forward leaning posture of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Cyber Field Office,\u201d said DCIS Director Kelly P. Mayo. \u201cThis investigation showcases the critical import of identifying and pursuing emerging threats and technologies targeting our warfighters, and the industrial base that supports them. Today\u2019s announcement illustrates the magnitude of cooperation within federal law enforcement and our foreign partners pursuing criminals in the rapidly evolving cybercrime arena.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that from 2018 until July 2022, Wang received approximately $99 million from his sales of the hijacked proxied IP addresses through his 911 S5 operation, either in cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Wang used the illicitly gained proceeds to purchase real property in the United States, St. Kitts and Nevis, China, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. The indictment identifies dozens of assets and properties subject to forfeiture, including a 2022 Ferrari F8 Spider S-A, a BMW i8, a BMW X7 M50d, a Rolls Royce, more than a dozen domestic and international bank accounts, over two dozen cryptocurrency wallets, several luxury wristwatches, 21 residential or investment properties (across Thailand, Singapore, the U.A.E., St. Kitts and Nevis, and the United States), and 20 domains.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement initially focused on 911 S5 during an investigation of a money laundering and smuggling scheme, where criminal actors in Ghana and the United States used hijacked IP addresses purchased from 911 S5 to place fraudulent orders using stolen credit cards on the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) online e-commerce platform known as ShopMyExchange. Although approximately 2,525 fraudulent orders valued at $5.5 million were submitted, credit card fraud detection systems and federal investigators were able to thwart the bulk of the attempted purchases, reducing the actual loss to approximately $254,000.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe conduct alleged here reads like it\u2019s ripped from a screenplay: A scheme to sell access to millions of malware-infected computers worldwide, enabling criminals over the world to steal billions of dollars, transmit bomb threats, and exchange child exploitation materials\u2014then using the scheme\u2019s nearly $100 million in profits to buy luxury cars, watches, and real estate,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). \u201cWhat they don\u2019t show in the movies though is the painstaking work it takes by domestic and international law enforcement, working closely with industry partners, to take down such a brazen scheme and make an arrest like this happen.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wang is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, substantive computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, Wang faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison.</p>\n<p>This operation was a coordinated multiagency effort led by law enforcement in the United States, Singapore, Thailand, and Germany. Agents and officers searched residences, seized assets valued at approximately $30 million, and identified additional forfeitable property valued at approximately $30 million. The operation also seized 23 domains and over 70 servers constituting the backbone of Wang\u2019s prior residential proxy service and the recent incarnation of the service. By seizing multiple domains tied to the historical 911 S5, as well as several new domains and services directly linked to an effort to reconstitute the service, the government has successfully terminated Wang\u2019s efforts to further victimize individuals through his newly formed service Clourouter.io and closed the existing malicious backdoors.</p>\n<p>On May 28, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2375\">issued financial sanctions</a> against Wang, Jingping Liu, and Yanni Zheng, for their activities associated with 911 S5, and three entities for being owned or controlled by Wang.</p>\n<p>The FBI Dallas and Denver Field Offices, DCIS Cyber Field Office, and BIS Office of Export Enforcement\u2019s Dallas field office are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Candy Heath and Lydia Lichlyter of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Camelia Lopez and William Tatum for the Eastern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The Department appreciates the significant assistance provided by the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers of Singapore, Singapore Police Force (SPF), Royal Thai Police, and the Office of the Attorney General and the Anti-Money Laundering Office of the Kingdom of Thailand. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section provided crucial support to this operation. The Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC also provided support to this operation. Additionally, the Department offers its thanks to Chainalysis, the Shadowserver Foundation, and Microsoft for the assistance provided by each during the investigation and the operation.</p>\n<p>For more information or to determine if you are a victim of 911 S5 malware, please visit <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/911S5\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.fbi.gov/911S5</a><em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department today announced a multi-agency law enforcement action, targeting armed drug trafficking networks in Washington, D.C., which resulted in 24 arrests in the past nine days. This action follows a surge in additional law enforcement tools and resources <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-surge-resources-fight-violent-crime-washington-dc\">announced</a> in January by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland to fight violent crime in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn January, the Justice Department surged law enforcement resources to the District of Columbia to further our efforts to target the individuals and organizations driving violent crime in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d said Attorney General Garland. \u201cOver the past nine days, as a result of a multi-agency investigation, we have arrested 24 individuals we allege have fueled drug trafficking and community violence in Washington, D.C. The Department will continue to leverage our partnerships, our resources, and our investigative and prosecutorial tools to reduce violent crime and keep communities safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will remain relentless in the pursuit of those who attempt to make money by selling fentanyl and other deadly drugs in our communities,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cWe are firmly committed to working with all of our partners and using all tools available to curb the violence impacting the American people \u2013 here in Washington, D.C., and across the country.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nine defendants were arrested today in connection with a Trinidad-based drug trafficking investigation. Three of the defendants arrested today are charged in a 13-count indictment alleging a conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, crack cocaine, and heroin and several firearms offenses. Two additional defendants arrested today are charged in a separate multiple-count indictment on fentanyl and fentanyl analogue distribution and firearms charges. These arrests follow another law enforcement action last week, in which 15 people were arrested, 10 of whom are named in a 17-count indictment as alleged members of a drug trafficking crew operating near 21st Street and Maryland Avenue, NE, and who are charged with participation in a fentanyl and cocaine distribution conspiracy and additional firearms counts.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s arrests grew out of an investigation into an open-air drug market around the 1100 block of Raum Street, NE, in the Trinidad neighborhood that was commenced in summer 2023 in response to 59 violent crime incidents and 119 bursts of gunfire occurring in the area from January to July 2023. Agents conducted numerous controlled buys of fentanyl, fentanyl analogue, cocaine base, and firearms in connection with this investigation.</p>\n<p>During the investigation, multiple search warrants were executed at several locations. Law enforcement executed 14 residential search warrants today in connection with the Trinidad investigation in the District and Maryland and seized 15 firearms, large amounts of ammunition, and alleged drug proceeds as part of the operation. At least three of the five defendants arrested today have been indicted on firearms charges, including possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictments, the defendants sold fentanyl and other dangerous drugs on the streets of Washington, D.C. Some of them also carried guns,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWhen armed drug dealers sell deadly drugs like fentanyl, they make our communities more dangerous places to live and work. Today\u2019s arrests reflect the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to working with U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and our law enforcement partners to protect our neighborhoods from armed drug dealers and other dangerous offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe data tells us that a relatively small group of people in our community are the primary drivers of gun violence and that the bulk of the gun violence is clustered in a relatively few blocks of our city,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cFor years, we and our law enforcement partners have been focused on developing effective strategies for how we can best build cases against these relatively few people driving violence because we know that proactively removing these people from our streets is the most significant thing we can do as prosecutors to impact violent crime trends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStreet-level drug traffickers are directly responsible for extreme violence and devastating drug poisonings in communities across the country,\u201d said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). \u201cThe individuals charged today are alleged members of one of the most violent criminal groups in Washington, D.C., perpetrating countless acts of violence and selling deadly fentanyl. The excellent investigative work by the DEA\u2019s Washington Field Division, and our partners, has made this community safer. These arrests are a warning to all criminals peddling poison on American streets that the DEA will use every available resource to save lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday's arrests show that the partnerships among federal and local law enforcement agencies are stronger than the illicit ties among members of drug trafficking organizations,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge David J. Scott of the FBI Washington Field Office\u2019s Criminal and Cyber Division. \"The FBI vows to continue to work with our partners to protect communities from violent crews who peddle drugs and wield illegal firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMany Washingtonians have raised concerns about local drug trafficking crews that have been taking over their neighborhoods through violence and the distribution of fentanyl and other illegal drugs,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Jarod Forget of the DEA Washington Division. \u201cDrug trafficking and violence are undeniably connected, and we are addressing this issue directly by taking a strong stance and implementing strict measures to combat the illegal manufacture and distribution of drugs, as well as removing firearms from the streets. Whether it's through increased law enforcement efforts, educational programs, or providing support for those struggling with substance misuse, we are confronting this problem head-on to restore the communities to the residents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe success of these operations would not have been possible without the collaboration, dedication, and support of the officers, investigators, and detectives of the Metropolitan Police Department, our federal partners at the FBI and DEA, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The unwavering commitment to upholding the law and protecting our communities is truly commendable,\u201d said Executive Assistant Chief Jeffery Carroll of the Metropolitan Police Department. \u201cTo those who continue to engage in violent crimes, drug sales and the illegal possession and use of firearms: let this serve as a clear message. Your actions bring tremendous harm to our communities, and they will not be tolerated. Operations like these will continue, our investigations are ongoing, and our resolve is steadfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Trinidad fentanyl trafficking investigation was a multi-agency effort between the DEA\u2019s Washington Division, Metropolitan Police Department, and FBI Washington Field Office\u2019s Violent Crimes Task Force. Trial Attorney Gerald A. A. Collins of the Criminal Division\u2019s Violent Crime and Racketeering Section (VCRS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nihar Mohanty for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance was provided by VCRS Trial Attorneys Christina Taylor and Gaelin Bernstein.</p>\n<p>The Carver-Langston fentanyl trafficking investigation was a multi-agency effort between the Metropolitan Police Department, FBI Washington Field Office\u2019s Cross-Border Task Force, DEA\u2019s Washington Division, and Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrea Duvall and Solomon Eppel for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department will aggressively prosecute those who target public servants and their families with violence. In a democracy, people vote, argue, and debate to achieve the policy outcome they desire. But the promise of democracy is that people will not employ violence to affect that outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDavid DePape, when he planned his attempted kidnapping, claimed he intended to punish the Speaker Emerita and teach Congress as a whole a lesson,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cHe then violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi. Today\u2019s sentence is a stern reminder to those who pursue violence against public officials and institutions that significant punishment will follow. I want to thank the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the members of my prosecution team \u2014 including Helen Gilbert, Laura Vartain, and Maddie Wachs \u2014 for bringing this matter to a swift and decisive conclusion. We hope that the conclusion of the federal case brings a measure of healing to Mr. Pelosi and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing of David DePape to a significant prison term sends a clear message that violence and intimidation have no place in our community or our political discourse,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp of the FBI San Francisco Field Office. \u201cDePape's attack, fueled by misguided ideology, underscores the dangers posed by extremist beliefs. The FBI is committed to protecting all citizens and ensuring that our democracy remains strong and resilient against those who seek to harm it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial established that, weeks before the attack, DePape targeted Nancy Pelosi, who was then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and collected personal information about her, including her home address. DePape kept the information in a computer file he labeled \u201cfavorite politicians.\u201d DePape intended to kidnap the then-Speaker, hold her hostage, and break her kneecaps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The evidence at trial demonstrated that on the night of the assault, DePape used public transportation to travel from the East Bay to San Francisco while carrying two backpacks that contained a hammer, sledgehammer, duct tape, rope, zip ties, and electronic items, among other items. After arriving at the Pelosi residence, DePape used the hammer to break the window of a glass door and enter the home. Then-Speaker Pelosi was not home and her husband, Paul Pelosi, was sleeping on the third floor of the home. DePape roamed the home until he found Paul Pelosi in the third-floor bedroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trial evidence demonstrated that DePape woke Paul Pelosi and, while standing three to four feet from him holding the hammer and restraints, made various threats including, \u201cI will take you out.\u201d Paul Pelosi managed to walk to his bathroom and call 9-1-1, during which he carefully used language to alert the emergency operator to the situation without agitating DePape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paul Pelosi convinced the defendant to go downstairs to the first floor and continued talking to DePape. When the police arrived, Paul Pelosi opened the door and the police ordered DePape to drop the hammer he was holding. Instead, DePape struck Paul Pelosi three times with full force, fracturing his skull. The responding officers immediately tackled DePape and took him into custody.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Nov. 9, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted DePape, charging him with one count of assault upon an immediate family member of a U.S. official with the intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the official while engaged in the performance of official duties or with intent retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, and one count of attempted kidnapping of a U.S. official on account of the performance of official duties. A jury convicted DePape of both charges.</p>\n<p>DePape will receive credit for the little over 18 months that he has been in custody since his crime.</p>\n<p>The FBI San Francisco Field Office, U.S. Capitol Police, and San Francisco Police Department are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California\u2019s National Security and Cyber Section is prosecuting the case.</p></div>",

As part of a Department-wide initiative \u2013 the DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative \u2013 the Department will continue to prioritize high-impact, strategic, and unified enforcement and disruption operations across the U.S. Government targeting U.S.-based enablers of unlawful DPRK IT workers overseas. Today\u2019s announcement follows successful Department-led action in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation\">October 2023</a> which targeted similar and related conduct.\u00a0</p><p>Under the Initiative, launched in March 2024 by the National Security Division and FBI Cyber and Counterintelligence Divisions, Department prosecutors and agents are prioritizing:</p><ul><li>The identification and shuttering of U.S.-based \u201claptop farms\u201d (<em>i.e.</em>, locations hosting laptops provided by victim U.S. companies to individuals they believed were legitimate U.S.-based freelance IT workers);</li><li>Investigations and prosecutions of U.S.-based witting enablers, as appropriate;</li><li>International partnerships with like-minded countries that also host IT worker support networks;</li><li>Improved speed, tempo, and content of notifications to victims, primarily unwitting U.S. companies; and</li><li>Enhanced partnerships with private sector online service providers, including in terms of identifying IT worker infrastructure and personas, improving the providers\u2019 in-house fraud detection methods, and educating compliance personnel and the public regarding the threat (<em>see e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20220516\">May 2022</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2023/PSA231018\">October 2023</a> advisories, as well as a new <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240516\">advisory</a> released today by the FBI).</li></ul><p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement reveals the complex web of deception and facilitators that is central to the North Korean regime\u2019s schemes to evade international sanctions to finance its weapons program,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe disruptions announced today represent a focused and continuing effort to dismantle these illicit networks and thereby prevent North Korean IT workers from victimizing unwitting U.S. companies. Through such sustained campaigns against this threat, the Department will continue to enhance our collective national security and cybersecurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI and its partners are committed to leveraging everything at our disposal to disrupt North Korean IT workers from subverting the rule of law in order to fund the DPRK\u2019s weapons of mass destruction program,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWe will continue our work of maintaining order in the cyber space and preventing bad actors from taking advantage of it for their strategic geopolitical objectives.\u201d</p><p>As alleged in court documents, the DPRK government dispatched thousands of skilled IT workers to live abroad, primarily in China and Russia, with the aim of deceiving U.S. and other businesses worldwide into hiring them as freelance IT workers, to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. The DPRK IT workers\u2019 scheme involved the use of pseudonymous email, social media, payment platform and online job site accounts, as well as false websites, proxy computers, and witting and unwitting third parties located in the United States and elsewhere. As described in a May 2022 tri-seal <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/923126/dl?inline\">public service advisory</a> released by the FBI, Department of the Treasury and Department of State, such IT workers have been known individually earn up to $300,000 annually, generating hundreds of millions of dollars collectively each year, on behalf of designated entities, such as the North Korean Ministry of Defense and others directly involved in the DPRK\u2019s UN-prohibited WMD programs.</p><p>***</p><p>Consistent with the goals of this initiative and prior to its inception, the District of Maryland led <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/criminal-complaint-charges-two-men-conspiracy-commit-wire-fraud\">enforcement actions</a> against Minh Phuong Vong of Bowie, Maryland, who was arrested this morning for his alleged participation in a scheme to assist overseas IT workers \u2013 posing with his identity \u2013 in working at U.S. companies in remote IT positions. Earlier this week, the FBI executed a premises search at Vong\u2019s residence.</p><p>Separately, the Eastern District of Missouri led a seizure action against 12 website domains used by DPRK IT workers to mimic western IT services firms to support the bona fides of their attempts to secure remote work contracts for U.S. and other businesses worldwide.</p><p>\u201cThe alleged schemes likely benefitted the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in evading U.S. sanctions and victimizing American businesses,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Larissa L. Knapp of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch. \u201cBy stealing the identities of American citizens to commit fraud, they obtained proceeds which likely helped fund the North Korean regime\u2019s priorities including nuclear weapons programs. The FBI and our partners are committed to rooting out insidious efforts that undermine our economic and national security.\u201d</p><p><u>Vong Premises Search, Complaint, and Arrest \u2013 District of Maryland</u></p><p>As part of an investigation pre-dating the initiative, Vong was arrested today and charged by criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p><p>According to the criminal complaint, Vong and other conspirators engaged in a scheme to fraudulently gain employment at companies located in the United States. These U.S. companies provided information technology services, including software development services, to the U.S. government. While Vong was nominally employed by these U.S. companies, he was not in fact the individual performing work for them. Remote IT workers based overseas instead posed as Vong and performed Vong\u2019s job duties.</p><p>According to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, in March 2023, as part of Vong\u2019s hiring process with a U.S. company, the Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. company conducted a video call with Vong where he verified Vong\u2019s identity with a U.S. passport and Maryland driver\u2019s license. A different individual, however, had appeared for an earlier interview for the position and later for work meetings during the course of Vong\u2019s employment. That individual, charged as a John Doe defendant in the criminal complaint, is a native of North Korea and a self-described software developer who claimed to be living in Shenyang, China.</p><p>As alleged in the complaint, throughout the course of Vong\u2019s employment with U.S. company, remote IT workers based overseas performed Vong\u2019s job duties by accessing protected victim computer systems via remote internet connections and posing as Vong on work-related videoconferences. Vong also shipped one or more laptops to an address in China. Vong also received payment from U.S. Company and other employers, which he then transmitted to individuals located overseas, keeping a percentage for himself.</p><p>The FBI Baltimore Field Office is investigating the case.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathleen O. Gavin for the District of Maryland is prosecuting the case with valuable assistance provided by Trial Attorney Alexandra Cooper-Ponte of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.</p><p><u>Fraudulent DPRK IT Work Website Seizures \u2013 Eastern District of Missouri</u></p><p>On May 15, pursuant to a court order issued in the Eastern District of Missouri, the Department seized 12 website domains used by DPRK IT workers to hide their true identities and locations when applying to do remote work for U.S. and other businesses worldwide. The specific group of DPRK IT workers who created these domains work for the PRC-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co. Ltd. and the Russia-based Volasys Silver Star, both of which were sanctioned in 2018 by the Department of the Treasury. These IT workers funneled income from their fraudulent IT work back to North Korea using online payment services and Chinese bank accounts.</p><p>\u201cShutting down these websites is just one of the ways we are working to disrupt the flow of money to the North Korean weapons program,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming for the Eastern District of Missouri. \u201cThe business community can do their part by carefully vetting their online hires.\u201d</p><p>The 12 website domains seized yesterday, partial images of which are included in the unsealed affidavit, were designed to appear as domains of legitimate, U.S.-based IT services companies located in Portland, Oregon; Houston; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Oklahoma City; Indianapolis; New York; and Richmond, Virginia. Three of the entities that claimed to own these domains were officially registered in Wyoming. The website contents included a variety of designed to entice potential victims, such as claims that the firms assisted hundreds of \u201chappy clients\u201d including Fortune 500 companies (potentially a fictitious claim) and completed hundreds of projects over thousands of work hours. Other websites included claims of having helped clients benefit from new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, \u201cblockchain solutions,\u201d cloud computing skills, and internet of things knowledge.</p><p>However, the website domains also included indicia that should have aroused suspicion about their bona fides.\u00a0 For example:</p><ul><li>The phone numbers used to register these domains, or advertised as belonging to these businesses, did not have area codes that corresponded with the locations where these businesses claimed to have offices;</li><li>Some of the addresses listed were homes, versus office buildings;</li><li>The content included disjointed phrases that appeared to be attempts at inspirational quotes \u2013 <em>e.g</em>., \u201cNor, moreover, is there anyone who loves pain because it is pain, pursues it, wants to gain it, but;\u201d and</li><li>Awkward promotional phrases such as \u201chere are our main features &amp; many more features.\u201d</li></ul><p>The National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri are investigating this case. The FBI St. Louis Field Office conducted the investigation, with the assistance of the FBI Cyber Division.</p><p>***</p><p>The FBI, along with the Departments of State and Treasury, issued a <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20220516\">May 2022 advisory</a> to alert the international community, private sector and public about the North Korea IT worker threat. Updated guidance was issued in <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231018\">October 2023</a> by the United States and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), which includes indicators to watch for that are consistent with North Korea IT worker fraud.</p><p>Concurrent with today\u2019s announcement and consistent with the initiative\u2019s goals, two additional <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/charges-and-seizures-brought-fraud-scheme-aimed-denying-revenue-workers-associated-north\">criminal prosecutions</a> in the District of Columbia were unsealed today, resulting in two arrests and the execution of related seizures and search warrants in multiple jurisdictions. Both prosecutions reflect investigations that predate the initiative\u2019s inception. Arizona woman Christina Marie Chapman was arrested on May 15 and three foreign nationals were charged on May 8 in connection with a similar IT worker scheme associated with North Korea. As part of this case, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office seized wages earned by more than 19 overseas IT workers and will seek their forfeiture. Additionally, the District of Columbia charged Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko for similar conduct. As alleged, Didenko created fake accounts at U.S. IT job search platforms and with money service transmitters. Didenko was arrested in Poland on May 6 pursuant to an arrest warrant from the United States.</p><p>The U.S. Department of State has offered potential\u00a0<a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/index/?north-korea=north-korea\">rewards for up to $5 million</a> in support of international efforts to disrupt North Korea\u2019s illicit financial activities, including for certain information related to individuals who are sent outside of North Korea to work to generate money for the North Korean government or who facilitate the activities of such North Korean nationals.</p><p><em>An indictment and a criminal complaint are merely allegations. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p><div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1352206/dl?inline\" title=\"12_domain_seizure_application_redacted.pdf\">EDMO seizure application</a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>",

The schemes described in court documents involved defrauding over 300 U.S. companies using U.S. payment platforms and online job site accounts, proxy computers located in the United States, and witting and unwitting U.S. persons and entities. This announcement includes the largest case ever charged by the Justice Department involving this type of IT workers\u2019 scheme.</p>\n<p>Two criminal prosecutions brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, one in partnership with the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, were unsealed today. As part of the prosecutions, two defendants have been arrested and related seizures and search warrants have been executed in Washington, D.C., and other jurisdictions. The investigations were led by the FBI Phoenix and New York Field Offices and IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), and coordinated with five other FBI field offices and four other U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, producing arrests in the United States and Poland, the execution of five premises search warrants, and the seizure of illicitly obtained wages and a website domain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Chapman and her co-conspirators committed fraud and stole the identities of American citizens to enable individuals based overseas to pose as domestic, remote IT workers,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0\u201cThe charges in this case should be a wakeup call for American companies and government agencies that employ remote IT workers.\u00a0These crimes benefitted the North Korean government, giving it a revenue stream and, in some instances, proprietary information stolen by the co-conspirators.\u00a0The Criminal Division remains firm in its commitment to prosecute complex criminal schemes like this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement of charges and law enforcement action show our broad approach to attacking funding sources for North Korea across the United States,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cWe will continue to vigorously pursue cases against individuals, in the United States and abroad, that use U.S. financial systems to raise revenue for North Korea.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the surface, today\u2019s allegations of wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering may read like a typical white collar or economic crime scheme,\u201d said Assistant Director Kevin Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cBut what these allegations truly represent is a new high-tech campaign to evade U.S. sanctions, victimize U.S. businesses, and steal U.S. identities. The charges clearly demonstrate how the FBI and its partners will employ every resource at our disposal to bring to justice anyone who helps North Korea evade sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p>An indictment was unsealed today in the District of Columbia against U.S. citizen Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona, related to her participation in a scheme to assist overseas IT workers\u2014posing as U.S. citizens and residents\u2014in working at more than 300 U.S. companies in remote IT positions. Chapman was arrested yesterday in Litchfield Park, Arizona.</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Chapman and her co-conspirators\u2019 scheme defrauded U.S. companies across myriad industries, including multiple well-known Fortune 500 companies, U.S. banks, and other financial service providers. The identities of more than 60 U.S. persons were compromised and used by IT workers related to Chapman\u2019s cell.</p>\n<p>In addition to Chapman, the indictment charged three foreign nationals with money laundering for their participation in the scheme. As alleged in the indictment, the department seized wages earned by more than 19 overseas IT workers and will seek forfeiture of the same.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a criminal complaint was unsealed today in the District of Columbia charging Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv, with a separate years-long scheme to create fake accounts at U.S. IT job search platforms and with U.S.-based money service transmitters.</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint, Didenko sold the accounts to overseas IT workers, some of whom he believed were North Korean, and the overseas IT workers used the false identities to apply for jobs with unsuspecting companies. Several U.S. persons had their identities used by IT workers related to Didenko\u2019s cell, and evidence in the complaint showed that the overseas IT workers using Didenko\u2019s services were also working with Chapman. Polish authorities arrested Didenko on May 6 at the request of the United States, which is seeking Didenko\u2019s extradition from Poland.</p>\n<p>Didenko\u2019s company\u2019s online domain, upworksell.com, was also seized today by the Justice Department pursuant to a court order, and all traffic diverted to the FBI.</p>\n<p>Related to the above schemes, the FBI executed search warrants for U.S. based \u201claptop farms,\u201d residences that hosted multiple laptops for overseas IT workers, wherein U.S.-based facilitators logged onto U.S. company computer networks and then allowed the overseas IT workers to remotely access those laptops through various software applications. The overseas IT workers used the laptop farms\u2019 U.S. Internet Protocol addresses to make it appear as though they were operating inside the United States. Chapman\u2019s residence was searched in October 2023 pursuant to a search warrant issued in the District of Arizona, resulting in evidence that is reflected in the indictment. Search warrants for four U.S. residences associated with laptop farms controlled by Didenko were issued in the Southern District of California, Eastern District of Tennessee, and Eastern District of Virginia, and executed between May 8 and May 10.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with today\u2019s announcement, the U.S. Department of State <a href=\"https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=99f92515-fcb54c44-99fe01f0-74fe48676e4a-7ec4fa7f76da2719&amp;q=1&amp;e=b44803a7-1fe0-4d83-b396-0a352452a32b&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frewardsforjustice.net%2Frewards%2Fnorth-korean-information-technology-it-workers%2F\">announced a reward</a> of up to $5 million for information related to Chapman\u2019s coconspirators: John Doe 1, alias Jiho Han; John Doe 2, alias Haoran Xu; John Doe 3, alias Chunji Jin; and an unindicted coconspirator utilizing aliases \u201cZhonghua\u201d and \u201cVenechor S.\u201d</p>\n<p><u>Chapman Indictment, Money Seizures, and Premises Warrant</u></p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the overseas IT workers associated with Chapman, many of whom were tied to North Korea, posed as U.S. citizens using the stolen, false, or borrowed identities of U.S. nationals, and applied for positions at U.S companies, causing the transmission of false documentation to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The overseas IT workers gained employment at U.S. companies, including at a top-five major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace manufacturer, an American car manufacturer, a luxury retail store, and a U.S.-hallmark media and entertainment company, all of which were Fortune 500 companies. Some of these companies were purposely targeted by a group of DPRK IT workers, who maintained postings for companies at which they wanted to insert IT workers.</p>\n<p>Chapman ran a \u201claptop farm,\u201d hosting the overseas IT workers\u2019 computers inside her home so it appeared that the computers were located in the United States, and also received and forged payroll checks and received direct deposits of the overseas IT workers\u2019 wages from the U.S. companies into her U.S. financial accounts. The overseas IT workers also attempted to gain employment and access to information at two different U.S. government agencies on three different occasions, although these efforts were generally unsuccessful. The overseas IT workers associated with Chapman\u2019s cell were paid millions for their work, much of which has been falsely reported to the IRS and the Social Security Administration in the name of the actual U.S. persons whose identities were stolen or borrowed. Chapman also allegedly conspired with the John Doe defendants to commit money laundering by conducting financial transactions under aliases to receive money generated by the scheme and transfer those funds outside of the United States, in an attempt to hide that these were proceeds of the IT workers\u2019 fraud.</p>\n<p>Chapman and her co-conspirators allegedly compromised more than 60 identities of U.S. persons, impacted more than 300 U.S. companies, caused false information to be conveyed to DHS on more than 100 occasions, created false tax liabilities for more than 35 U.S. persons, and resulted in at least $6.8 million of revenue to be generated for the overseas IT workers.\u00a0The department seized funds related to scheme from Chapman as well as wages and monies accrued by more than 19 overseas IT workers.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsing the stolen identities of U.S. citizens is a crime by itself, but when you use those identities to procure employment for foreign nationals with ties to North Korea at hundreds of U.S. companies, you have compromised the national security of an entire nation,\u201d said Chief Guy Ficco of IRS-CI. \u201cFor more than 100 years, IRS Criminal Investigation special agents have been following the money, and their financial expertise has once again stopped criminals in their tracks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chapman is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, operating as an unlicensed money transmitting business, and unlawful employment of aliens. The John Does are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, Chapman faces a maximum penalty of 97.5 years in prison, including a mandatory minimum of two years in prison on the aggravated identity theft count, and the John Does face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI Phoenix Field Office and IRS-CI Phoenix Field Office are investigating this case, with assistance from the FBI Chicago Field Office.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen P. Seifert for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Ashley R. Pungello of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting this case, with assistance from Paralegal Specialists Brian Rickers and Jorge Casillas. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona and Trial Attorney Gregory Nicosia of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section also provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p><u>Didenko Complaint, Domain Seizure, and Premises Warrants</u></p>\n<p>According to the criminal complaint, Didenko allegedly engaged in a multi-year scheme to create accounts at U.S.-based freelance IT job search platforms and with U.S. money service transmitters in the names of false identities, including identities of U.S. persons, and sold these accounts to overseas IT workers. Didenko ran a website, upworksell.com, which advertised creating, buying, and renting accounts at U.S. websites using false identities, and also advertised \u201cCredit Card Rental\u201d in the European Union and the United States and SIM card rental for cellular phones. Didenko allegedly offered a full array of services to allow an individual to pose under a false identity and market themselves for remote IT work with unsuspecting companies. As stated, Didenko\u2019s domain was seized as part of the case.</p>\n<p>According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, Didenko is alleged to have managed as many as approximately 871 \u201cproxy\u201d identities, provided proxy accounts for three freelance U.S. IT hiring platforms, and provided proxy accounts for three different U.S.-based money service transmitters. In coordination with his co-conspirators, Didenko facilitated the operation of at least three U.S.-based laptop farms, at one point hosting approximately 79 computers. Didenko sent or received $920,000 in U.S. dollar payments since July 2018.</p>\n<p>Didenko acknowledged in messages that he believed he was assisting North Korean IT workers. One of Didenko\u2019s overseas IT worker customers also requested that a laptop be sent from one of Didenko\u2019s U.S. laptop farms to Chapman\u2019s laptop farm, showing the interconnectivity of these cells within the DPRK overseas IT worker network. Search warrants of Didenko\u2019s laptop farms were executed in early May.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Didenko faces a maximum penalty of 67.5 years in prison, including a mandatory minimum of two years in prison on the aggravated identity theft count.</p>\n<p>The FBI New York Field Office is investigating this case. The FBI Norfolk and San Diego Field Offices and the Jefferson City, Tennessee, Resident Agency provided assistance in executing search warrants.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karen P.

The charges in the indictment arise from an alleged novel scheme by the defendants to exploit the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds. Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno were arrested yesterday in Boston and New York, respectively, and will be presented this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul G. Levenson for the District of Massachusetts and U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s indictment, the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cUnfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme. As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, the Department will continue to root out fraud, support victims, and restore confidence to these markets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, my office indicted two brothers \u2014 Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno \u2014 for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, all stemming from their alleged scheme to exploit the Ethereum blockchain and to obtain about $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from it,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question. The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe. And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete. This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged. But as the indictment makes clear, no matter how sophisticated the fraud or how new the techniques used to accomplish it, the career prosecutors of this office will be relentless in pursuing people who attack the integrity of all financial systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office. \u201cIn this case, IRS-CI New York\u2019s Cyber Unit simply followed the money. Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno are brothers who studied mathematics and computer science at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain in order to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from victim cryptocurrency traders (the \u201cExploit\u201d). Through the Exploit, which is believed to be the very first of its kind, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency. Once the defendants stole their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency, they rejected requests to return the stolen cryptocurrency and took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains.</p>\n<p>Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno meticulously planned the Exploit over the course of several months. Among other things, they learned the trading behaviors of the victim traders whose cryptocurrency they ultimately stole. As they planned the Exploit, they also took numerous steps to conceal their identities and lay the groundwork to conceal the stolen proceeds, including by setting up shell companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges. After the Exploit, the defendants transferred the stolen cryptocurrency through a series of transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds.</p>\n<p>Throughout the planning, execution, and aftermath of the Exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno also searched online for information about, among other things, how to carry out the Exploit, ways to conceal their involvement in the Exploit, cryptocurrency exchanges with limited \u201cknow your customer\u201d procedures that they could use to launder their criminal proceeds, attorneys with expertise in cryptocurrency cases, extradition procedures, and the very crimes charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count.</p>\n<p>IRS-CI New York\u2019s Cyber Investigations Unit investigated the case, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and New York City Police Department.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rushmi Bhaskaran and Danielle Kudla for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

At times, LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group in the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarlier this year, the Justice Department and our U.K. law enforcement partners disrupted LockBit, a ransomware group responsible for attacks on victims across the United States and around the world,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cToday we are going a step further, charging the individual who we allege developed and administered this malicious cyber scheme, which has targeted over 2,000 victims and stolen more than $100 million in ransomware payments. We will continue to work closely alongside our partners, across the U.S. government and around the world to disrupt cybercrime operations like LockBit and to find and hold accountable those responsible for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs part of our unrelenting efforts to dismantle ransomware groups and protect victims, the Justice Department has brought over two dozen criminal charges against the administrator of LockBit, one of the world\u2019s most dangerous ransomware organizations,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cWorking with U.S. and international partners, we are using all our tools to hold ransomware actors accountable\u2014and we continue to encourage victims to report cyberattacks to the FBI when they happen. Reporting an attack could make all the difference in preventing the next one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432), also known as LockBitSupp, LockBit, and putinkrab, 31, of Voronezh, Russia, is charged by a 26-count indictment returned by a grand jury in the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment of LockBit developer and operator Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev continues the FBI\u2019s ongoing disruption of the LockBit criminal ecosystem,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe LockBit ransomware group represented one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe, causing billions of dollars in losses and wreaking havoc on critical infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. The charges announced today reflect the FBI\u2019s unyielding commitment to disrupting ransomware organizations and holding the perpetrators accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment against Khoroshev unsealed today follows a recent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">disruption</a> of LockBit ransomware in February by the U.K. National Crime Agency\u2019s (NCA) Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization\u2019s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. That disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit\u2019s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by the indictment unsealed today.</p>\n<p>\u201cDmitry Khoroshev conceived, developed, and administered Lockbit, the most prolific ransomware variant and group in the world, enabling himself and his affiliates to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage to thousands of victims around the globe,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cHe thought he could do so hidden by his notorious moniker \u2018LockBitSupp,\u2019 anonymous and free of any consequence, while he personally pocketed $100 million extorted from Lockbit\u2019s victims. Through relentless investigation and coordination with our partners at the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the FBI and abroad, we have proven him and his coconspirators wrong. Today\u2019s indictment marks a significant milestone in the investigation and prosecution of LockBit, which has already led to charges against five other LockBit affiliates\u2014two of whom are in custody awaiting trial\u2014and a major disruption of the now discredited LockBit operation.\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition, as previously announced, law enforcement developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Victims targeted by this malware are encouraged to contact the FBI at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/</a> to enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment and other documents previously unsealed in the District of New Jersey:</p>\n<p><u>Khoroshev and the LockBit Ransomware Group</u></p>\n<p>Khoroshev allegedly acted as the LockBit ransomware group\u2019s developer and administrator from its inception in or around September 2019 through May 2024. Khoroshev and his affiliate coconspirators, grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware variant in the world. The LockBit ransomware group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries, including 1,800 victims in the United States. LockBit victims included individuals, small businesses, multinational corporations, hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. Khoroshev and his co-conspirators extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in broader losses, such as lost revenue, incident response, and recovery.</p>\n<p>Khoroshev allegedly designed LockBit to operate in the \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d (RaaS) model. In his role as the LockBit developer and administrator, Khoroshev arranged for the design of the LockBit ransomware code itself, recruited other LockBit members\u2014called affiliates\u2014to deploy it against victims, and maintained the LockBit infrastructure, including an online software dashboard called a \u201ccontrol panel\u201d to provide the affiliates with the tools necessary to deploy LockBit. Khoroshev also maintained LockBit\u2019s public-facing website\u2014called a \u201cdata leak site\u201d\u2014for the publication of data stolen from victims who refused to pay a ransom.</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Khoroshev\u2014as the LockBit developer\u2014typically received a 20% share of each ransom payment extorted from LockBit victims. The affiliate responsible for an attack would receive the remaining 80%. During the scheme, Khoroshev alone allegedly received at least $100 million in disbursements of digital currency through his developer shares of LockBit ransom payments.</p>\n<p>LockBit infrastructure seized by law enforcement through the February 2024 disruption allegedly showed that Khoroshev retained copies of data stolen from LockBit victims who had paid the demanded ransom.</p>\n<p>Khoroshev and his affiliate co-conspirators had falsely promised those victims that their stolen data would be deleted after payment. Moreover, after the February 2024 disruption, Khoroshev allegedly communicated with law enforcement and urged them to disclose the identities of his RaaS competitors\u2014whom Khoroshev called his \u201cenemies\u201d\u2014in exchange for his services.</p>\n<p>Khoroshev is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, extortion, and related activity in connection with computers; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; eight counts of intentional damage to a protected computer; eight counts of extortion in relation to confidential information from a protected computer; and eight counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer. In total, those charges carry a maximum penalty of 185 years in prison. Each of the 26 counts charged by the indictment also carries a maximum fine of the greatest of $250,000, pecuniary gain to the offender, or pecuniary harm to the victim.</p>\n<p><u>The LockBit Investigation</u></p>\n<p>With the indictment unsealed today, a total of six LockBit members have now been charged for their participation in the LockBit conspiracy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In February 2024, an indictment was unsealed in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant\">Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev</a>, also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries.</li>\n<li>In June 2023, a criminal complaint was filed in the District of New Jersey charging <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-arrested-and-charged-conspiring-commit-lockbit-ransomware-attacks-against-us\">Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov</a>, a Russian national, in connection with his participation in the LockBit group.

Matveev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at <a href=\"http://www.tips.fbi.gov/\">tips.fbi.gov/</a>.</li>\n<li>Finally, in November 2022, a criminal complaint was filed in the District of New Jersey charging <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-participation-lockbit-global-ransomware-campaign\">Mikhail Vasiliev</a> in connection with his participation in the LockBit ransomware group. Vasiliev, a dual Russian-Canadian national, is currently in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck, Debra Ireland, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the charges against Khoroshev.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, Office of International Affairs, and National Security Division also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced today that it is designating Khoroshev for his role in launching cyberattacks.

Garland.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeploying the REvil ransomware variant, the defendant reached out across the globe to demand hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. victims,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cBut this case shows the Justice Department\u2019s reach is also global\u2014working with our international partners, we are bringing to justice those who target U.S. victims, and we are disrupting the broader cybercrime ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, the FBI\u2019s close collaboration with our worldwide partners has again ensured that a cybercriminal who thought he was beyond our reach faces the consequences of his actions,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cWe will continue to relentlessly pursue cyber criminals like Vasinksyi wherever they may hide, while we disrupt their criminal schemes, seize their money and infrastructure, and target their enablers and criminal associates to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, also known as Rabotnik, 24, conducted thousands of ransomware attacks using the ransomware variant known as Sodinokibi/REvil. \u00a0Ransomware is malicious software designed to encrypt data on victim computers, allowing bad actors the ability to demand a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. The co-conspirators demanded ransom payments in cryptocurrency and used cryptocurrency exchangers and mixing services to hide their ill-gotten gains. To drive their ransom demands higher, Sodinokibi/REvil co-conspirators also publicly exposed their victims\u2019 data when victims would not pay ransom demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYaroslav Vasinskyi and his co-conspirators hacked into thousands of computers around the world and encrypted them with ransomware,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThen they demanded over $700 million in ransom payments and threatened to publicly disclose victims\u2019 data if they refused to pay. Although the conspirators attempted to cover their tracks by laundering the payments from victims, Vasinskyi could not hide from law enforcement. Vasinskyi\u2019s sentence today should serve as a reminder to ransomware actors everywhere: we will track you down and bring you to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUsing ransomware, malicious actors from around the globe can paralyze U.S. companies in a matter of minutes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton for the Northern District of Texas. \u201cBut as cybercriminals work together to deploy these attacks, law enforcement throughout the United States stands ready to dismantle their criminal enterprises. The dedicated prosecutors from the Northern District of Texas and the skilled agents at the FBI Dallas Field Office proved once again today to ransomware actors everywhere: When you hit targets in the United States, the Justice Department and its partners will come after you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vasinskyi previously pleaded guilty in the Northern District of Texas to an 11-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was previously extradited to the United States from Poland.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Relatedly, in 2023, the Department obtained the final forfeiture of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of ransom payments obtained through two related civil forfeiture cases, which included 39.89138522 Bitcoin and $6.1 million in U.S. dollar funds traceable to alleged ransom payments received by other members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The FBI investigated the case.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel Frank Lin of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers for the Northern District of Texas prosecuted the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dimitri N. Rocha for the Northern District of Texas assisted with the related civil forfeiture cases.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs worked with Polish authorities to secure the extradition of Vasinskyi.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A federal jury in New Haven, Connecticut, convicted a Nigerian national today for operating a business email compromise scheme out of multiple countries, including the United States.</p>\n<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Okechuckwu Valentine Osuji, 39, and his co-conspirators targeted specific individuals and businesses by masquerading as trustworthy entities in electronic communications to obtain money. They utilized unwitting and witting \u201cmoney mules\u201d to receive fraud proceeds in their bank accounts, and then transferred those funds to accounts under the control of Osuji and his co-conspirators or to convert the stolen proceeds to cash for further transfer. Over the course of the scheme\u2019s years-long operation, numerous victims were tricked into transferring funds into bank accounts the victims believed were under the control of legitimate recipients of the funds as part of normal business operations, when in reality, the bank accounts were controlled by Osuji and his co-conspirators. As a result of the scheme, losses and intended losses totaled over $6.3 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cOsuji led a network of scammers in Malaysia and elsewhere in a sophisticated business email compromise scheme to defraud victims of millions of dollars,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cToday\u2019s conviction is another example of how the department\u2019s collaboration with international law enforcement partners enables us to bring cybercriminals to justice in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile it is often difficult to identify and bring to justice cybercriminals operating overseas, today\u2019s verdict demonstrates the expertise of the FBI and Stamford Police in uncovering this criminal network, and the shared commitment of our counterparts in Malaysia to ensure that fraudsters are held accountable in a court of law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery for the District of Connecticut. \u201cWe will continue to work to root out those who engage in internet fraud schemes, no matter where in the world they operate, and achieve justice for victims of these crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendant perpetrated a complex international business email compromise scheme and laundered millions in stolen proceeds,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Timothy R. Langan Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. \u201cThis conviction is the result of hard work and close collaboration between the FBI and our local and international partners. Together, we will work aggressively to bring to justice anyone who engages in fraud and theft against Americans, no matter where they are in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict provides a bit of closure to some victims of these often financially crippling crimes,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert Fuller of the FBI New Haven Field Office. \u201cIt also displays our international ability to bring criminal actors to justice despite the complexities of their crimes. We want to thank all of our law enforcement partners here and abroad, as well as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, for their dedication to serving justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Osuji of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 24 and faces a mandatory minimum of two years on the identity theft count and a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison on the wire fraud and conspiracy counts. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Osuji was arrested in Malaysia and extradited to the United States in 2022. His alleged co-conspirator, John Wamuigah, remains in Malaysia and is pending extradition proceedings. Another co-conspirator, Tolulope Bodunde, pleaded guilty on Feb. 16.</p>\n<p>The FBI New Haven Field Office and the Stamford Police Department investigated the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Royal Malaysia Police, and Malaysian Attorney General\u2019s Chambers provided valuable assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Osuji.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Lydia Lichlyter of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret M. Donovan for the District of Connecticut are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Doherty for the District of Connecticut provided valuable assistance to the investigation.</p>\n<p>If you believe that you have been victimized by Valentine Osuji, John Wamuigah, or Tolulope Bodunde, please contact the FBI New Haven Field Office at 203-777-6311 and ask for FBI Task Force Officer Michael Stempien.

Rao of the Civil Division. \u201cWe will continue to identify perpetrators of these schemes and prioritize the pursuit of those who deliberately target vulnerable consumers, whether located in the United States or abroad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, these 16 defendants preyed upon grandparents\u2019 familial love and devotion, cheating them out of millions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cIn this \u2018grandparents\u2019 scam,\u2019 the defendants allegedly impersonated grandchildren in distress, claiming, for example, they had been arrested after a car accident involving a pregnant woman who later miscarried, and they needed immediate cash for bail or a lawyer. The panic-stricken grandparents quickly paid \u2014 sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. My office is committed to protecting the rights of all victims, and we will relentlessly prosecute those who allegedly target vulnerable seniors to steal their hard-earned savings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement stems from the defendants\u2019s alleged heartless targeting of elderly victims who were collectively tricked into handing over millions of dollars,\" said Acting Special Agent in Charge Darren B. McCormack of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. \u201cFor their own selfish gain, these accused individuals threatened innocent Americans\u2019 livelihoods and robbed them of their precious time and any nest eggs they had secured for themselves. I commend HSI New York\u2019s El Dorado Task Force Cyber Intrusion Group, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey, the NYPD, the FBI, the Social Security Office of Inspector General and HSI Santo Domingo for their outstanding collaboration and coordination. This can truly happen to anybody, and while we will always be there to assist victims, we hope that raising awareness will give these criminal opportunists fewer chances to target the public.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFraud targeting the elderly has a uniquely harmful effect on a segment of the population that is often amongst society's most vulnerable,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley Parker of the Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General (SSA-OIG), Boston New York Field Division. \u201cSSA OIG is proud to join HSI, the FBI, the Justice Department and the NYPD in investigating these complex, international scams aimed at defrauding SSA beneficiaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese charges underscore law enforcement\u2019s commitment to protecting our older population from fraudsters and financial exploitation,\u201d said Commissioner Edward A. Caban of the New York Police Department (NYPD). \u201cThe crimes outlined here are truly depraved in their nature: targeting our parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, and others in an elaborate venture to bilk them of their hard-earned savings. I applaud our NYPD investigators and all of our federal partners involved in this important case for their tireless dedication to our shared public safety mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI and its partners are deeply committed to keeping our elderly population out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. \u201cEven when components of these grandparent scams are being perpetuated from beyond our borders, those who engage in illicit activity seeking to defraud the American people can be assured that their actions have consequences. If you or someone you know is a victim of elder fraud, please come forward and report it.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court, Juan Rafael Parra Arias, Nefy Vladimir Parra Arrias and Gonzalez Acevedo operated a sophisticated network of call centers in the Dominican Republic. Their alleged victims included elderly residents of several states, including New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The call centers victimized hundreds of Americans through fraud, stealing millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Members of the conspiracy referred to as \u201copeners\u201d called elderly victims in the United States and impersonated the victims\u2019 children, grandchildren, or other close relatives. The call centers used technology to make it appear that the calls were coming from inside the United States. Typically, the victim was told that their grandchild had been in a car accident, was arrested in connection with an accident, and needed help.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once openers tricked victims into believing their loved ones were in dire trouble, others working at the call centers, known as \u201cclosers,\u201d allegedly impersonated defense attorneys, police officers or court personnel and convinced victims to provide thousands of dollars in cash to help their loved ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to charging documents, closers, including defendants Rodriguez Guzman, Fortuna Solano, Reynoso Ventura and Estevez typically told victims to give the cash to couriers who they sent to victims\u2019 homes to collect their money. Other times, closers instructed victims to send the cash by mail.</p>\n<p>Once victims were convinced to give cash, call center \u201cdispatchers,\u201d including Rodriguez Serrano, Vasquez, Rosario Garcia, and Dilone Rodriguez, recruited and managed a network of U.S.-based couriers to obtain cash from the elderly victims across the northeastern United States.</p>\n<p>Those U.S.-based couriers, including the five charged by complaint, typically went to the elderly victims\u2019 home to pick up the cash, often using false names and providing victims with fake receipts. The couriers then brought the cash to other members of the conspiracy, who sent the victims\u2019 money to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty 20 years in prison for each count, a maximum fine of $250,000 for each count of the mail and wire fraud charges and a maximum fine of $500,000 for each count of money laundering.</p>\n<p>Deputy Assistant Attorney Rao joined U.S. Attorney Sellinger, Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy of the FBI\u2019s Newark Division and Deputy Special Agent in Charge McCormack of Homeland Security Investigations New York made the announcement.</p>\n<p>HIS, SSA-OIG, NYPD, and the FBI are investigating the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jason Feldman, Joshua Ferrentino and Emily Powers of the Civil Division's Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Silane for the District of Jersey are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311). This Justice Department hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, can provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim and identifying relevant next steps. Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis. Reporting is the first step. Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses. The hotline is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET. English, Spanish, and other languages are available.</p>\n<p>More information about the department\u2019s efforts to help American seniors is available at its Elder Justice Initiative webpage.

The defendants remain at large.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with today\u2019s unsealing, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice program (RFJ) is offering a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA/status/1782824365127500272\">reward of up to $10 million</a> for information leading to the identification or location of the group and the defendants. The RFJ program seeks information on any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, engages in certain malicious cyber activities in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Additionally, the Treasury Department <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2292\">announced sanctions</a> against the four defendants, among other malicious cyber actors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cCriminal activity originating from Iran poses a grave threat to America\u2019s national security and economic stability,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThese defendants are alleged to have engaged in a coordinated, multi-year hacking campaign from Iran targeting more than a dozen American companies and the U.S. Treasury and State Departments. This case represents just one part of the U.S. government\u2019s effort to counter the range of threats originating from Iran that endanger the American people.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is constantly working to detect and counter cyber campaigns like the one described in today\u2019s indictment. From enabling lethal plots and repressing our citizens and residents to targeting our critical infrastructure, we\u2019ve often seen the trail of dangerous cyber-criminal activity lead back to Iran,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates the FBI\u2019s commitment to using every lawful tool at our disposal, together with our domestic and international partners, to disrupt the threats posed from Iran to American businesses and citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s charges pull back the curtain on an Iran-based company that purported to provide \u2018cybersecurity services\u2019 while in actuality scheming to compromise U.S. private and public sector computer systems, including through spearphishing and social engineering attacks,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe Department is committed to using a whole of government approach to disrupt such malicious activities and impose consequences on the individuals that carry them out.\u00a0 Employees that continue to work at these companies risk arrest and prosecution or a lifetime as an international fugitive from justice.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged,\u00a0the defendants\u00a0participated in a cyber campaign using spearphishing and other hacking techniques\u00a0in an attempt to compromise private companies with access to defense-related information,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cCyber intrusion schemes such as the one alleged threaten our national security, and I\u2019m proud of our law enforcement partners and the career prosecutors of this office for continuing to use innovative technologies and investigative measures to disrupt and track down these cybercriminals.\u00a0If you have information leading to the to the identification or location of\u00a0Harooni, Kazemifar, Salmani, or Nasab, please reach out to the Department of State at\u00a0<a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/\">rewardsforjustice.net</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, from at least in or about 2016 through at least in or about April 2021, Harooni, Kazemifar, Salmani, Nasab, and other conspirators were members of a hacking organization that participated in a coordinated multi-year campaign to conduct and attempt to conduct computer intrusions. These intrusions targeted more than a dozen U.S. companies and the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State.</p>\n<p>During the conspiracy, Kazemifar, Salmani, and Nasab were employed by Mahak Rayan Afraz (\u0645\u062d\u06a9 \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0632), an Iran-based company that purported to provide cybersecurity services, but which was, in fact, a front for the conspirators\u2019 operations.</p>\n<p>The hacking group\u2019s private sector victims were primarily cleared defense contractors, which are companies that have been granted security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense to access, receive, and store classified information for the purpose of conducting activities in support of U.S. Department of Defense programs. In addition, the group targeted a New York-based accounting firm and a New York-based hospitality company.</p>\n<p>In conducting their hacking campaigns, the group used spearphishing \u2014 tricking an email recipient into clicking on a malicious link \u2014 to infect victim computers with malware. During their campaigns against one victim, the group compromised more than 200,000 employee accounts. In another campaign, the conspirators targeted 2,000 employee accounts. In order to manage their spearphishing operations, the group created and used a particular computer application that enabled the conspirators to organize and deploy their spearphishing attacks.</p>\n<p>In the course of these spearphishing attacks, the conspirators compromised an administrator email account belonging to a defense contractor (Defense Contractor-1). Access to this administrator account empowered the conspirators to create unauthorized Defense Contractor-1 accounts, which the conspirators then used to send spearphishing campaigns to employees of a different defense contractor and a consulting firm.</p>\n<p>In addition to spearphishing, the conspirators utilized social engineering, which involved impersonating others, generally women, to obtain the confidence of victims. These social engineering contacts were another means the conspiracy used to deploy malware onto victim computers and compromise those devices and accounts.</p>\n<p>Kazemifar was responsible for testing the tools utilized by the conspiracy to execute its cyber campaigns. For example, Kazemifar was involved in testing spearphishing emails used to target victim companies and was involved in developing malware utilized by the conspiracy in social engineering initiatives. During the course of his involvement in the conspiracy, from at least in or about 2014 through at least in or about 2020, Kazemifar also worked for the Iranian Organization for Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense (EWCD). EWCD is a component of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is itself a component of the Iranian Armed Forces. Among other things, the IRGC is responsible for Iran\u2019s offensive cyber capabilities. The United States has designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>Harooni was responsible for procuring, administering, and managing the online network infrastructure, including computer servers and customized software used to facilitate the computer intrusions. Harooni also fraudulently used the identity of a real person (Individual-1), including his use of a copy of Individual-1\u2019s true passport, to conceal his role in procuring online infrastructure used by the conspiracy to facilitate the computer intrusion campaign.</p>\n<p>Salmani was responsible for testing tools utilized by the conspiracy to execute spearphishing campaigns, including the campaign against a hospitality company. Salmani was also involved in maintaining infrastructure used by the conspirators.</p>\n<p>Nasab was responsible for procuring infrastructure used by the conspiracy, particularly infrastructure used in furtherance of social engineering campaigns. Nasab also used Individual-1\u2019s identity, including Individual-1\u2019s name and passport, to register server and email accounts that were used during malicious cyber campaigns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The defendants are each charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud. If convicted, they face up to five years in prison for the computer fraud conspiracy, and up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Harooni is additionally charged with knowingly damaging a protected computer, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Harooni, Salamani, and Nasab are additionally charged with aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory consecutive term of two years in prison. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI Cyber Division is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan B. Finkel, Dina McLeod, and Daniel G. Nessim for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case, with assistance from Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department\u2019s COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force (CFETF) today released its 2024 report detailing the efforts of the task force and its member agencies in response to widespread fraud involving many COVID-19 relief programs targeted by fraudsters and other criminals who sought to exploit the government\u2019s relief efforts for their personal gain.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince I established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force three years ago, we have charged more than 3,500 defendants, seized or forfeited over $1.4 billion in stolen COVID-19 relief funds, and filed more than 400 civil lawsuits resulting in court judgements and settlements,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cOur work is not over. We will continue our efforts to investigate and prosecute pandemic relief fraud and to recover the assets that have been stolen from American taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n<p>To date, the efforts of the task force\u2019s member agencies has led to criminal charges against more than 3,500 defendants for losses of over $2 billion, civil enforcement actions resulting in more than 400 civil settlements and judgments of over $100 million, and over $1.4 billion seized or forfeited.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorking with law enforcement and the Inspector General community, the Department of Justice has deployed a data-driven prosecution strategy to combat COVID-19 fraud\u2014to the tune of over 3,500 defendants charged and more than $1.4 billion seized or forfeited,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cBut the time is now to ensure law enforcement has what it needs to finish the job. The statute of limitations must be extended and the necessary funding and data analytic tools secured for our prosecutors to recover hundreds of millions of dollars more in fraud proceeds, bring remaining offenders to justice, and disrupt criminal networks that continue to victimize our citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I am incredibly proud of the work of the CFETF and the significant law enforcement accomplishments, much work remains in the fight against COVID-19 fraud,\u201d said Director Michael C. Galdo of the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. \u201cThe CFETF and its member agencies have ongoing investigations into hundreds of identity thieves, transnational fraud and money laundering networks, large-dollar individual fraudsters, and the businesses that facilitated these crimes. CFETF member agencies have improved their data analytics capabilities and are using these new skills to investigate fraud more efficiently and effectively.\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition to the efforts noted above, the CFETF has established five strike forces to focus on the most complex and harmful pandemic fraud\u2014often committed by overseas, organized, or violent actors. Those strike forces, located in the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country including the Districts of Maryland, New Jersey, Colorado, the Southern District of Florida, and a joint task force co-located in the Eastern and Central Districts of California, are responsible for indicting 250 defendants to date, including gang members, inveterate fraudsters, and overseas rings committing a myriad of cyber-enabled fraud against our citizens and government programs.</p>\n<p>CFETF members also established the National Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force, a first-of-its-kind task force that developed a data sharing and lead development process within OCDETF\u2019s International Organized Crime Intelligence Operation Center (IOC-2), using data from pandemic relief programs. The NUIFTF has used that process to disseminate over 100 leads and intelligence associated with over $3 billion in suspected pandemic fraud.</p>\n<p>In May 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Justice Department in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The task force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p>The CFETF members include Justice Department components, including the Criminal Division, Civil Division, U.S. Attorneys, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, FBI, Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, Office of the Inspector General, National Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force, and INTERPOL Washington; and key interagency partners, including Homeland Security Investigations, IRS Criminal Investigations, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and multiple representatives of the Office of Inspector General community, including Department of Labor, Department of Treasury, Tax Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Small Business Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Federal Reserve Board, Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus/media/1347161/dl?inline\">CFETF 2024 Report</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus/media/1347156/dl?inline\" title=\"Fact Sheet\">Fact Sheet\u00a0</a></p></div>",

This indictment underscores our unwavering commitment to disrupt and deter malicious cyber activity, and safeguard our citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure from threats\u00a0in cyberspace.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment unsealed today, together with statements from our foreign partners regarding related activity, shed further light on the PRC Ministry of State Security\u2019s aggressive cyber espionage and transnational repression activities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cToday\u2019s announcements underscore the need to remain vigilant to cybersecurity threats and the potential for cyber-enabled foreign malign influence efforts, especially as we approach the 2024 election cycle. The Department of Justice will continue to leverage all tools to disrupt malicious cyber actors who threaten our national security and aim to repress fundamental freedoms worldwide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese allegations pull back the curtain on China\u2019s vast illegal hacking operation that targeted sensitive data from U.S. elected and government officials, journalists, and academics; valuable information from American companies; and political dissidents in America and abroad. Their sinister scheme victimized thousands of people and entities across the world, and lasted for well over a decade,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cAmerica\u2019s sovereignty extends to its cyberspace. Today\u2019s charges demonstrate my office\u2019s commitment to upholding and protecting that jurisdiction, and to putting an end to malicious nation state cyber activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe recent indictments against the Chinese actors reaffirm the FBI\u2019s relentless dedication to combating cyber threats,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI Cyber Division. \u201cThey serve as a reminder that cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our nation\u2019s systems and target US officials cannot rely on the cloak of anonymity and will face consequences for their actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAPT31 Group\u2019s practices further demonstrate the size and scope of the PRC\u2019s state-sponsored hacking apparatus,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert W. \u201cWes\u201d Wheeler Jr. of the FBI Chicago Field Office. \u201cFBI Chicago worked tirelessly to uncover this complex web of alleged foreign intelligence and economic espionage crimes. Thanks to these efforts, as well as our partnerships with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and fellow Field Offices, the FBI continues to be successful in holding groups accountable and protecting national security.\u201d</p>\n<p><b><u>Overview</u></b></p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment and court filings, the defendants, along with dozens of identified PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) intelligence officers, contractor hackers, and support personnel, were members of a hacking group operating in the PRC and known within the cybersecurity community as Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (the APT31 Group). The APT31 Group was part of a cyberespionage program run by the MSS\u2019s Hubei State Security Department, located in the city of Wuhan. Through their involvement with the APT31 Group, since at least 2010, the defendants conducted global campaigns of computer hacking targeting political dissidents and perceived supporters located inside and outside of China, government and political officials, candidates, and campaign personnel in the United States and elsewhere and American companies.</p>\n<p>The defendants and others in the APT31 Group targeted thousands of U.S. and foreign individuals and companies. Some of this activity resulted in successful compromises of the targets\u2019 networks, email accounts, cloud storage accounts, and telephone call records, with some surveillance of compromised email accounts lasting many years.</p>\n<p><b><u>Hacking Scheme</u></b></p>\n<p>The more than 10,000 malicious emails that the defendants and others in the APT31 Group sent to these targets often appeared to be from prominent news outlets or journalists and appeared to contain legitimate news articles. The malicious emails contained hidden tracking links, such that if the recipient simply opened the email, information about the recipient, including the recipient\u2019s location, internet protocol (IP) addresses, network schematics, and specific devices used to access the pertinent email accounts, was transmitted to a server controlled by the defendants and those working with them. The defendants and others in the APT31 Group then used this information to enable more direct and sophisticated targeted hacking, such as compromising the recipients\u2019 home routers and other electronic devices.</p>\n<p>The defendants and others in the APT31 Group also sent malicious tracking-link emails to government officials across the world who expressed criticism of the PRC government. For example, in or about 2021, the conspirators targeted the email accounts of various foreign government individuals who were part of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), a group founded in 2020 on the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests whose stated purpose was to counter the threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the international order and democratic principles. The targets included every European Union member of IPAC, and 43 United Kingdom parliamentary accounts, most of whom were members of IPAC or had been outspoken on topics relating to the PRC government.</p>\n<p>To gain and maintain access to the victim computer networks, the defendants and others in the APT31 Group employed sophisticated hacking techniques including zero-day exploits, which are exploits that the hackers became aware of before the manufacturer, or the victim were able to patch or fix the vulnerability. These activities resulted in the confirmed and potential compromise of economic plans, intellectual property, and trade secrets belonging to American businesses, and contributed to the estimated billions of dollars lost every year as a result of the PRC\u2019s state-sponsored apparatus to transfer U.S. technology to the PRC.</p>\n<p><b><u>Targeting of U.S. Government Officials and U.S. and Foreign Politicians and Campaigns</u></b></p>\n<p>The targeted U.S. government officials included individuals working in the White House, at the Departments of Justice, Commerce, Treasury, and State, and U.S. Senators and Representatives of both political parties. The defendants and others in the APT31 Group targeted these individuals at both professional and personal email addresses. Additionally in some cases, the defendants also targeted victims\u2019 spouses, including the spouses of a high-ranking Department of Justice official, high-ranking White House officials, and multiple U.S. Senators. Targets also included election campaign staff from both major U.S. political parties in advance of the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>The allegations in the indictment regarding the malicious cyber activity targeting political officials, candidates, and campaign personnel are consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-departments-justice-and-homeland-security-assessing-impact-foreign\">March 2021 Joint Report</a> of the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security on Foreign Interference Targeting Election Infrastructure or Political Organization, Campaign, or Candidate Infrastructure Related to the 2020 US Federal Elections. That report cited incidents when Chinese government-affiliated actors \u201cmaterially impacted the security of networks associated with or pertaining to U.S. political organizations, candidates, and campaigns during the 2020 federal elections.\u201d That report also concluded that \u201csuch actors gathered at least some information they could have released in influence operations,\u201d but which the Chinese actors did not ultimately deploy in such a manner. Consistent with that conclusion, the indictment does not allege that the hacking furthered any Chinese government influence operations against the United States. The indictment\u2019s allegations nonetheless serve to underscore the need for U.S. <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/china-state-affiliated-actors-target-uk-democratic-institutions-parliamentarians\">(and allied)</a> political organizations, candidates, and campaigns to remain vigilant in their cybersecurity posture and in otherwise protecting their sensitive information from foreign intelligence services, particularly in light of the U.S. Intelligence Community\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.odni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf\">assessment</a> that \u201c[t]he PRC may attempt to influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions.\u201d</p>\n<p><b><u>Targeting of U.S. Companies</u></b></p>\n<p>The defendants and others in the APT31 Group also targeted individuals and dozens of companies operating in areas of national economic importance, including the defense, information technology, telecommunications, manufacturing and trade, finance, consulting, legal, and research industries. The defendants and others in the APT31 Group hacked and attempted to hack dozens of companies or entities operating in these industries, including multiple cleared defense contractors who provide products and services to the U.S. military, multiple managed service providers who managed the computer networks and security for other companies, a leading provider of 5G network equipment, and a leading global provider of wireless technology, among many others.</p>\n<p><b><u>Targeting for Transnational Repression of Dissidents</u></b></p>\n<p>The defendants and the APT31 Group also targeted individual dissidents around the world and other individuals who were perceived as supporting such dissidents. For example, in 2018, after several activists who spearheaded Hong Kong\u2019s Umbrella Movement were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the defendants and the APT31 Group targeted Norwegian government officials and a Norwegian managed service provider. The conspirators also successfully compromised Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and their associates located in Hong Kong, the United States, and other foreign locations with identical malware.</p>\n<p>The charged defendants\u2019 roles in the conspiracy consisted of testing and exploiting the malware used to conduct these intrusions, managing infrastructure associated with these intrusions, and conducting surveillance and intrusions against specific U.S. entities. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheng Feng, Sun Xiaohui, Weng Ming, Xiong Wang, and Zhao Guangzong were involved in testing and exploiting malware, including malware used in some of these intrusions.</li>\n<li>Cheng and Ni Gaobin managed infrastructure associated with some of these intrusions, including the domain name for a command-and-control server that accessed at least 59 unique victim computers, including a telecommunications company that was a leading provider of 5G network equipment in the United States, an Alabama-based research corporation in the aerospace and defense industries, and a Maryland-based professional support services company.</li>\n<li>Sun and Weng operated the infrastructure used in an intrusion into a U.S. company known for its public opinion polls. Sun and Peng Yaowen conducted research and reconnaissance on several additional U.S. entities that were later the victims of the APT31 Group\u2019s intrusion campaigns.</li>\n<li>Ni and Zhao sent emails with links to files containing malware to PRC dissidents, specifically Hong Kong legislators and democracy advocates, as well as targeting U.S. entities focusing on PRC-related issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Douglas M. Pravda, Saritha Komatireddy, and Jessica Weigel for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from Matthew Anzaldi and Matthew Chang of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</i></p></div>",

These intrusions targeted more than a dozen U.S. companies and the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State. Nasab remains at large.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile purporting to work as a cybersecurity specialist for Iran-based clients, Mr. Nasab allegedly participated in a persistent campaign to compromise U.S. private sector and government computer systems,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cToday\u2019s charges highlight Iran\u2019s corrupt cyber ecosystem, in which criminals are given free rein to target computer systems abroad and threaten U.S. sensitive information and critical infrastructure. Our National Security Cyber Section remains focused on disputing these cross-border hacking schemes and holding those responsible to account.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Alireza Shafie Nasab participated in a cyber campaign using spear phishing and other hacking techniques to infect more than 200,000 victim devices, many of which contained sensitive or classified defense information,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cCyber intrusion schemes such as the one alleged threaten our national security, and I\u2019m proud of our law enforcement partners and the career prosecutors of this office for using innovative technologies and investigative measures to disrupt and track down these cybercriminals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will leverage all of its capabilities in combating the threat posed by Iranian hacker organizations to America\u2019s public and private sectors,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThe close collaboration with partners that led to today\u2019s unsealed indictment of Alireza Shafie Nasab will continue to keep the pressure on cyber adversaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hacking group\u2019s private sector victims were primarily cleared defense contractors, which are companies that support U.S. Department of Defense programs. In addition, the group targeted a New York-based accounting firm and a New York-based hospitality company.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, in conducting their hacking campaigns, the group used spear phishing \u2014 that is, tricking an email recipient into clicking on a malicious link \u2014 to infect victim computers with malware. In the course of their campaigns against one victim, the group compromised more than 200,000 victim employee accounts. At another victim, the conspirators targeted 2,000 employee accounts. In order to manage their spearphishing campaigns, the group created and used a particular computer application, which enabled the conspirators to organize and deploy their spear phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>In the course of these spear phishing attacks, the conspirators compromised an administrator email account belonging to a defense contractor (Defense Contractor-1). Access to this administrator account empowered the conspirators to create unauthorized Defense Contractor-1 accounts, which the conspirators then used to send spear phishing campaigns to employees of a different defense contractor and a consulting firm.</p>\n<p>In addition to spearphishing, the conspirators utilized social engineering, which involved impersonating others, generally women, in order to obtain the confidence of victims. These social engineering contacts were another means the conspiracy used to deploy malware onto victim computers and compromise those devices and accounts.</p>\n<p>Nasab took part in these schemes. During his participation in the scheme, he was employed by Mahak Rayan Afraz, an Iran-based company that purported to provide cybersecurity services, but which was, in fact, a front for the conspirators\u2019 operations. Nasab was responsible for procuring infrastructure used by the conspiracy. During the course of this conduct, Nasab used the stolen identity of a real person in order to register a server and email accounts used in the course of the cyber campaigns.</p>\n<p>Nasab is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory consecutive term of two years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the unsealing of the indictment, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice Program is offering a <a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/alireza-shafie-nasab/\">reward of up to $10 million</a> for information leading to the identification or location of Nasab.</p>\n<p>Anyone with information on Nasab and his malicious cyberactivity should contact Rewards for Justice via their Tor-based tips-reporting channel at:</p>\n<p>he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (the Tor browser is required).</p>\n<p>The FBI New York Field Office and Cyber Division are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan B. Finkel, Dina McLeod and Daniel G. Nessim for the Southern District of New York\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance from Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Today, U.S. and U.K. law enforcement are taking away the keys to their criminal operation,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAnd we are going a step further \u2014 we have also obtained keys from the seized LockBit infrastructure to help victims decrypt their captured systems and regain access to their data. LockBit is not the first ransomware variant the Justice Department and its international partners have dismantled. It will not be the last.\u201d</p>\n<p>Additionally, the NCA, in cooperation with the FBI and international law enforcement partners, has developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Beginning today, victims targeted by this malware are encouraged to contact the FBI at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov/</a> to enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s actions are another down payment on our pledge to continue dismantling the ecosystem fueling cybercrime by prioritizing disruptions and placing victims first,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cUsing all our authorities and working alongside partners in the United Kingdom and around the world, we have now destroyed the online backbone of the LockBit group, one of the world\u2019s most prolific ransomware gangs. But our work does not stop here: together with our partners, we are turning the tables on LockBit \u2014 providing decryption keys, unlocking victim data, and pursuing LockBit\u2019s criminal affiliates around the globe.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Justice Department also unsealed an indictment obtained in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev, also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries. Today, additional criminal charges against Kondratyev were unsealed in the Northern District of California related to his deployment in 2020 of ransomware against a victim located in California.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, the Department also unsealed two search warrants issued in the District of New Jersey that authorized the FBI to disrupt multiple U.S.-based servers used by LockBit members in connection with the LockBit disruption. As disclosed by those search warrants, those servers were used by LockBit administrators to host the so-called \u201cStealBit\u201d platform, a criminal tool used by LockBit members to organize and transfer victim data.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, the FBI and our partners have successfully disrupted the LockBit criminal ecosystem, which represents one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u201cThrough years of innovative investigative work, the FBI and our partners have significantly degraded the capabilities of those hackers responsible for launching crippling ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure and other public and private organizations around the world. This operation demonstrates both our capability and commitment to defend our nation's cybersecurity and national security from any malicious actor who seeks to impact our way of life. We will continue to work with our domestic and international allies to identify, disrupt, and deter cyber threats, and to hold the perpetrators accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am proud to stand with our U.K. partners to announce the coordinated law enforcement actions announced today \u2014 including the disruption of the LockBit ransomware variant and charges against two Russian nationals for using LockBit to attack victims throughout the United States,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. \u201cThrough our attorneys in the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and our U.S. Attorney\u2019s office partners, we have seized U.S.-based infrastructure used by LockBit actors, and the FBI, along with international partners, have developed tools to help victims whose systems have been encrypted. These actions send a clear message: the Justice Department and its law enforcement partners are united in the fight against cybercrime and are committed to using all available tools to disrupt ransomware activity and bring cybercriminals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment obtained in the District of New Jersey, from at least as early as January 2021, Sungatov allegedly deployed LockBit ransomware against victim corporations and took steps to fund additional LockBit attacks against other victims. Sungatov allegedly deployed LockBit ransomware against manufacturing, logistics, insurance, and other companies located in Minnesota, Indiana, Puerto Rico, Wisconsin, Florida, and New Mexico. Additionally, as early as August 2021, Kondratyev similarly began to allegedly deploy LockBit against multiple victims. Kondratyev, operating under the online alias \u201cBassterlord,\u201d allegedly deployed LockBit against municipal and private targets in Oregon, Puerto Rico, and New York, as well as additional targets located in Singapore, Taiwan, and Lebanon. Both Sungatov and Kondratyev are alleged to have joined in the global LockBit conspiracy, also alleged to have included Russian nationals Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev and Mikhail Vasiliev, as well as other LockBit members, to develop and deploy LockBit ransomware and to extort payments from victim corporations.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment, unsealed as part of a global coordinated action against the most active ransomware group in the world, brings to five the total number of LockBit members charged by my office and our FBI and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section partners for their crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cAnd, even with today\u2019s disruption of LockBit, we will not stop there. Our investigation will continue, and we remain as determined as ever to identify and charge all of LockBit\u2019s membership \u2014 from its developers and administrators to its affiliates. We will put a spotlight on them as wanted criminals. They will no longer hide in the shadows.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the indictment unsealed today, a total of five LockBit members have now been charged for their participation in the LockBit conspiracy. In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging Matveev with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Matveev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at <a href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov\">https://tips.fbi.gov</a>. In November 2022, a criminal complaint was filed in the District of New Jersey charging Vasiliev in connection with his participation in the LockBit global ransomware campaign. Vasiliev, a dual Russian-Canadian national, is currently in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States. In June 2023, Russian national Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov was charged by criminal complaint in the District of New Jersey for his participation in the LockBit conspiracy, including his deployment of LockBit against victims in Florida, Japan, France, and Kenya. Astamirov is currently in custody in the United States awaiting trial.</p>\n<p>Kondratyev, according to the indictment obtained in the Northern District of California and unsealed today, is also charged with three criminal counts arising from his use of the Sodinokibi, also known as REvil, ransomware variant to encrypt data, exfiltrate victim information, and extort a ransom payment from a corporate victim based in Alameda County, California.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The LockBit ransomware variant first appeared around January 2020 and, leading into today\u2019s operation, had grown into one of the most active and destructive variants in the world. LockBit members have executed attacks against more than 2,000 victims in the United States and around the world, making at least hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in ransom demands and receiving over $120 million in ransom payments. The LockBit ransomware variant, like other major ransomware variants, operates in the \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d (RaaS) model, in which administrators, also called developers, design the ransomware, recruit other members \u2014 called affiliates \u2014 to deploy it, and maintain an online software dashboard called a \u201ccontrol panel\u201d to provide the affiliates with the tools necessary to deploy LockBit. Affiliates, in turn, identify and unlawfully access vulnerable computer systems, sometimes through their own hacking or at other times by purchasing stolen access credentials from others. Using the control panel operated by the developers, affiliates then deploy LockBit within the victim computer system, allowing them to encrypt and steal data for which a ransom is demanded to decrypt or avoid publication on a public website maintained by the LockBit developers, often called a data leak site.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey and Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck, Debra Ireland, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the charges against Sungatov and Kondratyev unsealed today in the District of New Jersey. The Justice Department\u2019s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust and Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>The disruption announced today was the result of a joint operation between the FBI; NCA South West Regional Organised Crime Unit; France\u2019s\u00a0 Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command; Germany\u2019s Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein and the Bundeskriminalamt; Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Police, Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Canton of Zurich, and Zurich Cantonal Police; Japan\u2019s National Policy Agency; Australian Federal Police; Sweden\u2019s Polismyndighetens; Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Politie Dienst Regionale Recherche Oost-Brabant of the Netherlands; Finland\u2019s Poliisi; Europol; and Eurojust.</p>\n<p>The FBI Phoenix Field Office and Assistant U.S. Attorney Helen L. Gilbert are investigating and prosecuting the case against Kondratyev in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced today that it is designating Sungatov and Kondratyev for their roles in launching cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, victims of LockBit should contact the FBI at <a href=\"https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov\">https://lockbitvictims.ic3.gov</a> for further information.

Federal authorities in Atlanta and Boston also unsealed indictments charging individuals in Malta and Nigeria, respectively, for their alleged involvement in selling the malware and supporting cybercriminals seeking to use the malware for malicious purposes.</p>\n<p>Federal authorities in Boston seized www.warzone.ws and three related domains, which together offered for sale the Warzone RAT malware \u2014 a sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) capable of enabling cybercriminals to surreptitiously connect to victims\u2019 computers for malicious purposes. According to court documents authorizing the seizures, the Warzone RAT provided cybercriminals the ability to browse victim file systems, take screenshots, record keystrokes, steal victim usernames and passwords, and watch victims through their web cameras, all without the victims\u2019 knowledge or permission.</p>\n<p>Investigations by the FBI Boston and Atlanta Field Offices also led to two indictments against individuals involved in selling and supporting the Warzone RAT and other malware.</p>\n<p>Daniel Meli, 27, of Zabbar, Malta, was arrested on Feb. 7 at the request of the United States, following a coordinated operation by the Malta Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General of Malta, with the support of the FBI and Justice Department. Meli made his initial appearance before a Magistrate Judge in Valletta, Malta. Meli was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia on Dec. 12, 2023, for four offenses, including causing unauthorized damage to protected computers, illegally selling and advertising an electronic interception device, and participating in a conspiracy to commit several computer intrusion offenses. According to charging documents, since at least 2012, Meli offered malware products and services for sale to cybercriminals through online computer-hacking forums. Specifically, Meli allegedly assisted cybercriminals seeking to use RATs for malicious purposes and offered teaching tools for sale, including an eBook. Meli also allegedly sold both the Warzone RAT and, before that, malware known as the Pegasus RAT, which he sold through an online criminal organization called Skynet-Corporation. He also provided online customer support to purchasers of both RATs. The Northern District of Georgia is seeking Meli\u2019s extradition to the United States.</p>\n<p>Separately, Prince Onyeoziri Odinakachi, 31, of Nigeria, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts on Jan. 30 for conspiracy to commit multiple computer intrusion offenses, including obtaining authorized access to protected computers to obtain information and causing unauthorized damage to protected computers. According to charging documents, between June 2019 and no earlier than March 2023, Odinakachi provided online customer support to individuals who purchased and used the Warzone RAT malware. Law enforcement officers of the Port Harcourt Zonal Command of Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission arrested Odinakachi on Feb. 7.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The disruption of the Warzone RAT infrastructure was the result of an international law enforcement effort led by FBI special agents in Boston and Atlanta and coordinated with international partners in large part through Europol. According to court documents, in addition to discovering instances of the Warzone RAT being used to attack victim computers in Massachusetts, the FBI covertly purchased and analyzed the Warzone RAT malware, confirming its multiple malicious functions. Separately, law enforcement partners in Canada, Croatia, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania provided valuable assistance securing the servers hosting the Warzone RAT infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s actions targeting the Warzone RAT infrastructure and personnel are another example of our tenacious and unwavering commitment to dismantling the malware tools used by cybercriminals,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District of Massachusetts.\u00a0 \u201cWe will turn over every stone to prevent cybercriminals from attacking the integrity of our computer networks, and we will root out those who support such cybercriminals so they will be held accountable. Those who sell malware and support cybercriminals using it should know that they cannot hide behind their keyboards or international borders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDaniel Meli will no longer escape accountability for his actions selling malware,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia. \u201cThis alleged cybercriminal facilitated the takeover and infection of computers worldwide. Our office was proud to partner with our federal and international counterparts to find Meli and bring him to justice.\u00a0We will continue to diligently investigate and prosecute cybercrime in the Northern District of Georgia, and in all parts of the globe where our district is impacted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis action highlights the FBI\u2019s commitment to disrupting cybercriminal actors and taking down their infrastructure,\u201d said Assistant Director Brian Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThe FBI is proud of the international coordination involved in this law enforcement effort, and we will continue to build global partnerships to go after cybercriminals who seek to harm the American people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The charges of conspiracy, obtaining authorized access to protected computers to obtain information, illegally selling an interception device, and illegally advertising an interception device each provide for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of causing unauthorized damage to protected computers provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys James R. Drabick and Carol E. Head for the District of Massachusetts obtained the seizure warrants, and Drabick is prosecuting Odinakachi. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bethany L. Rupert and Michael Herskowitz for the Northern District of Georgia are prosecuting Meli.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance during the investigation.

Additionally, the United States seized $108 million used as part of these defendants\u2019 scheme to fund the IRGC-QF.</p>\n<p>In a related action, in the District of Columbia, a Chinese woman and Omani man are charged with sanctions-evasion and money laundering offenses in connection with the trafficking and selling of Iranian oil to Chinese government-owned refineries. Additionally, in the District of Columbia, a forfeiture complaint for the seizure of illicit Iranian oil was unsealed, alleging that more than 500,000 barrels of Iranian fuel is forfeitable under terrorism laws as property that provides a source of funding to the IRGC and IRGC-QF.</p>\n<p>\u201cIran utilizes the proceeds of its black-market oil sales to fund its criminal activities, including its support of the IRGC, Hamas, Hizballah, and other Iranian aligned terrorist groups,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department is targeting this funding source by seizing over $108 million and 500,000 barrels of fuel that would otherwise have enabled Iran to further its destabilizing activities that threaten our national security. In addition to disrupting Iran\u2019s unlawful funding streams, the Justice Department has also charged nine individuals for their roles in supporting Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.

The charges and seizures announced today strike at the core of the global oil smuggling network that Iran has built to fund its regime of terror and repression, and deny the regime millions of dollars in proceeds to further its nefarious agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIran presents a constant threat to the United States \u2013 trying to murder Americans right here within our borders, conducting a cyber-attack on a children\u2019s hospital, supporting terrorists around the world, and more,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cAll of Iran\u2019s crimes cost money. And the FBI will remain committed to enforcing U.S. sanctions that keep money out of its coffers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s cases are part of the Department\u2019s ongoing efforts to cut off the flow of black-market Iranian oil that funds the regime\u2019s malign activity, threatening the United States and our interests around the world,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0 \u201cWe remain focused on holding accountable those involved in these smuggling schemes, from the officials who oversee the laundering operations, to the network of shadowy businesses that enable them, to the brokers who help facilitate these unlawful transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>United States v. Shahriyari et al. </i>(SDNY)</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1336966/dl?inline\" title=\"u.s._v._shahriyari_et_al_indictment.pdf\">Note: view the indictment here</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Seven defendants \u2013 including a senior IRGC-QF official, the son of Rostam Ghasemi, a former IRGC Commander and Iranian Minister of Petroleum, an Iranian shipping official, an agent of the IRGC-QF \u2013 are charged in a five-count indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court. In connection with these charges, the United States has seized $108 million that China Oil &amp; Petrolium Company Limited, an IRGC front company, attempted to launder through correspondent transaction accounts at U.S. financial institutions in furtherance of the scheme to fund the IRGC-QF\u2019s malign activities through the illicit sale of Iranian oil. In addition, the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2073\">announced today</a> that it has sanctioned China Oil &amp; Petroleum Company Limited for its role in the oil trafficking network.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, the IRGC and its Qods Force have been instrumental in the Iranian regime\u2019s violent suppression of political dissent, targeting of Iranian dissidents living abroad, and support of international terrorism \u2014 including groups like Hamas, Hizballah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Today\u2019s charges show how, as alleged, the IRGC\u2019s Qods force built a sprawling international network of front companies to launder sanctioned Iranian oil using lies, forgery, and threats of violence,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cThis alleged scheme to finance the Qods Force succeeds through the complicity of wealthy businessmen in countries like Turkey who are eager to turn a corrupt profit from supporting terror groups. The Qods Force oil-laundering network allegedly delivered millions of barrels of Iranian oil to government-affiliated buyers in Russia, China, and Syria, and transferred billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system. This office has long served at the forefront of law enforcement efforts to fight terrorism and terror finance and to protect the integrity of the U.S. banking system. I commend the tireless and outstanding efforts of our law enforcement partners in unraveling and disrupting the IRGC\u2019s scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment charges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1217#:~:text=and%20Mashhad%2C%20Iran.-,Behnam%20Shahriyari,-and%20Shahriyari%20Trading\">Behnam Shahriyari</a>, 58, an Iranian national, is a publicly identified IRGC-QF senior official.

In response, the <a>IRGC-QF </a>built a large-scale global oil laundering network to give Iran\u2019s government-owned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) illicit access to global markets to sell crude oil and petroleum products and to use the proceeds to finance the IRGC-QF.</p>\n<p>To sell NIOC crude oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the network used an intermediary company in Lebanon to conceal the Government of Iran\u2019s involvement in the oil sales and a ship management company based in India to buy, lease, and manage oil tankers to use in the scheme. The oil tanker fleet was supervised by Aliakbari, and the key agreements between the Government of Iran and its foreign partners were authorized and approved by IRGC-QF Commander Rostam Ghasemi, who previously served as Iran\u2019s Minister of Oil, Minister of Transportation and Urban Development, and the Iranian chair of the Iranian-Syrian Economic Relations Development Committee.</p>\n<p>To sell NIOC crude oil to government-affiliated buyers in China, the network used the ASB Group of companies in Turkey, owned by Sitki Ayan, as well as intermediary companies in Oman, Greece, and elsewhere. Commander Ghasemi again authorized and approved key agreements between the Government of Iran and its foreign partners and resolved financial disputes that arose among the participants in the scheme. Companies in the ASB Group acted as intermediaries in the oil sales to conceal the Government of Iran\u2019s role and the Iranian origin of the oil and leased oil tankers that were operated by co-conspirators. Sitki Ayan\u2019s son and senior ASB Group officer, Bahaddin Ayan, assisted Sitki Ayan in the scheme and caused millions of dollars of wire transfers through the U.S. banking system for the leasing and operation of oil tankers. Oztas, who was a manager of the ASB Group of companies, also assisted Sitki Ayan in carrying out the scheme and finalizing agreements with ASB Group\u2019s partners. Shahriyari, Karimian, and Aliakbari participated in negotiations among the participants and monitored the progress of the oil sales, oil shipments, and the IRGC-QF\u2019s receipt of the oil proceeds.</p>\n<p>To sell NIOC crude oil to government-affiliated buyers in Russia, the network again used the ASB Group of companies, along with other companies in the United Arab Emirites, Cyprus, Russia, and Turkey. Shahriyari and Karimian organized a complex web of companies, with Sitki Ayan\u2019s ASB Group of companies at the center, to launder NIOC oil and the proceeds through layered transactions with a Cypriot company and to launder the oil sales through bulk cash smuggling and trade-based money laundering involving Russian agricultural products. Commander Ghasemi and his co-conspirators, including Karimian, controlled the proceeds of the oil sales, which were collected in Russia and transferred through cash couriers, Sitki Ayan\u2019s companies, or the Iranian Embassy in Moscow.</p>\n<p>In furtherance of the oil-laundering scheme, the defendants used a myriad of deceptive techniques including: 1) the use of front companies and intermediaries in countries outside of Iran to disguise the IRGC\u2019s role in the oil transactions and the Iranian source of the oil; 2) the use of falsified documentation to misrepresent the source of the oil and deceive unwitting companies and banks and cause them to provide services in furtherance of the scheme; and 3) the use of ship-to-ship transfers and the manipulation of location and shipping data for vessels used in furtherance of the scheme in order to obscure the loading and unloading of their Iranian oil cargoes and avoid the identification of the vessels used to facilitate the oil laundering.</p>\n<p>One of the key IRGC-QF front companies involved in the scheme was China Oil and Petroleum Company Limited (China Oil and Petroleum), which, despite its name, was controlled from Iran by Commander Ghasemi and his associates, including Karimian. China Oil and Petroleum acted as an intermediary in sales of NIOC oil, including deals involving Sitki Ayan\u2019s ASB Group of companies, in order to facilitate the ultimate delivery to government-affiliated buyers in China. Between at least 2019 and the present, China Oil and Petroleum has been involved in the transfer of more than $2 billion through the U.S. financial system in furtherance of the scheme to finance the IRGC-QF.</p>\n<p>Each of the defendants is charged with: (i) conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; (ii) conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against the Governments of Iran and Syria, global terrorists and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; (iii) conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; (iv)\u00a0conspiring to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and (v) conspiring to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael D. Lockard, David W. Denton Jr., and Nicholas S. Bradley are prosecuting the case, with assistance from Trial Attorneys David Lim, Beaudre Barnes, and Christopher Magnani of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and Trial Attorneys Joshua Champagne and Jennifer Levy of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section.</p>\n<p><i>United States v. Wang et al. </i>(DDC)</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1336986/dl?inline\" title=\"wang_indictment.pdf\">Note: View the indictment here.</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Two defendants \u2013 Shaoyun Wang, 54, of China, and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0320#:~:text=numerous%20terrorist%20groups.-,MAHMOOD%20RASHID%20AMUR%20AL%20HABSI,-Omani%20national%20Al\">Mahmood Rashid Amur Al Habsi</a>, 39, of Muscat, Oman \u2013 are charged in a 12-count indictment that was unsealed today in the District of Colombia. The indictment charges the defendants with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against Iran; conspiracy to commit money laundering, and money laundering stemming from their scheme to sell Iranian petroleum to Chinese government-owned refineries and illegally use the U.S. financial system to facilitate the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil to benefit the IRGC. Also unsealed today was a warrant for a related seizure of $8.5 million connected to this network.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only way that Iran can illegally sell oil is if people and business organizations outside Iran help it to do so,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cThe indictment unsealed today demonstrates that the U.S. government will seek to hold accountable those who knowingly help Iran illegally sell oil \u2013 wherever in the world they are located.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, between December 2019 and July 2021, Wang, Al Habsi, and other co-conspirators negotiated the sale of and sold illicit Iranian oil to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). They allegedly obtained the oil from Iran using surreptitious means which included AIS spoofing and multiple transfers between ocean-going tankers. The scheme relied on the use of the U.S. financial system and was facilitated by Turkish, Omani, and U.S. persons and entities, all in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that Wang and Al Habsi created fraudulent documents to mask that the oil originated from Iran, used electronic communications to arrange for Chinese buyers of the Iranian oil, used shell corporations to launder the proceeds through the U.S. financial system and provided false information to the U.S. companies about the source of the money generated by the transactions. In addition, the defendants used U.S. companies as a \u201ctrust\u201d to hold the profits for the IRGC.</p>\n<p>Al Habsi, acting through one of his companies, procured a $16.5 million loan in June 2020 from U.S. financial companies to purchase an oil tanker, later named M/T Oman Pride. Beginning in July 2020, the Oman Pride transported Iranian oil, which was ultimately transferred to third-party vessels for sale to Chinese government-owned refineries and companies in China.</p>\n<p>As alleged, Wang used a U.S. front company, worked with a U.S. person, and relied on U.S. financial institutions to facilitate the sale of the Iranian oil to China. Wang \u2013 who served as a director of a Chinese oil refinery \u2013 was also the chair of a U.S. company in Las Vegas, Nevada, and general manager of the U.S. company\u2019s Hong Kong-based parent company. The Hong Kong company acted as a front for transactions. Wang engaged with senior IRGC officials to effect the purchases. The scheme resulted in millions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions that were processed by U.S. banks and facilitated by U.S. persons.</p>\n<p>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Washington D.C. and the FBI Minneapolis Field Office are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karen Seifert, Maeghan Mikorski, Rajbir Datta, and Prava Palacharla for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case, with assistance from Trial Attorneys David Lim, Beaudre Barnes, and Christopher Magnani of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and Trial Attorneys Joshua Champagne and Jennifer Levy of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section.</p>\n<p><i>U.S. v. Approximately 523,507 Barrels Aboard Crude Oil Tanker Abyss </i>(DDC)</p>\n<p>A civil forfeiture complaint was unsealed today in the District of Columbia, alleging that more than 500,000 barrels of Iranian fuel oil valued at over $25 million previously onboard M/T Abyss is forfeitable under terrorism laws as property that provides a source of funds to the IRGC and IRGC-QF.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe complaint unsealed today is the latest in a series of actions our Office has taken to seize and to forfeit oil that Iran has attempted to illegally sell,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cForfeiture actions like this one disrupt Iran\u2019s efforts to illegally sell oil. The proceeds from these illegal sales are the lifeblood of the Iranian\u2019s efforts to sew war and terror around the globe, disrupting these sales is critical to our national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>The document alleges a scheme to facilitate the shipment and sale of Iranian fuel oil for the benefit of the IRGC and the IRGC-QF. The IRGC and its facilitators used deceptive practices to masquerade the oil as Iraqi, including manipulating the vessel\u2019s automatic identification system reporting and presenting falsified documents.</p>\n<p>The civil forfeiture action further alleges that the fuel oil constitutes the property of the NIOC, which has provided material support to the IRGC and IRGC-QF. As alleged, profits from petroleum product sales support the IRGC\u2019s full range of malign activities, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, support for terrorism, and both domestic and international human rights abuses.</p>\n<p>Funds successfully forfeited with a connection to a state sponsor of terrorism may in whole or in part be directed to the\u00a0U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.</p>\n<p>The FBI Minneapolis Field Office and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York are investigating the Abyss case related to Iranian fuel oil, and other cases were investigated by these offices as well as HSI\u2019s Washington, D.C. and Colorado Springs offices.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karen P. Seifert, Maeghan O. Mikorski, Brian Hudak, Rajbir S. Datta, and Erika Oblea for the District of Columbia are litigating the case related to Iranian fuel oil aboard the Abyss, with support from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. They received assistance from Paralegal Specialist Brian Rickers. The U.S. Marshals Service provided significant assistance in this matter.</p>\n<p><i>A civil forfeiture complaint is merely an allegation. The burden to prove forfeitability in a civil forfeiture proceeding is upon the government.</i></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>These enforcement actions are the latest in Justice Department efforts to combat the illicit trafficking of Iranian oil in violation of U.S. law. On Sept. 8, 2023, the Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-announces-first-criminal-resolution-involving-illicit-sale-and\">announced</a> a seizure of oil onboard the tanker Suez Rajan, a criminal plea by its ownership company, and a deferred prosecution agreement by its operating company, all arising out of the tanker\u2019s transport of illicit Iranian oil. The oil was sold for $74 million, and the proceeds of the sale are now subject to the civil forfeiture process.</p>\n<p>These recent actions build on prior enforcement cases the Department of Justice has brought in the District of Columbia related to seizures of illicit Iranian oil since 2019. For example, on July 1, 2020, the Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/largest-us-seizure-iranian-fuel-four-tankers\">filed</a> a civil asset forfeiture complaint against all the petroleum seized onboard the four oil tankers, the Bella, Bering, Pandi, and Luna, which were carrying Iranian petroleum to Venezuela. The petroleum onboard these four tankers was sold for approximately $45 million.</p>\n<p>Similarly, on Feb. 2, 2021, the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/complaint-seeks-forfeiture-iranian-oil-aboard-tanker-based-connection-terror-group\">filed</a> a civil asset forfeiture against all petroleum seized onboard the oil tanker Achilleas, which was transporting NIOC petroleum. The petroleum on the Achilleas was sold for approximately $111 million.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-federal-agencies-issue-joint-advisory-safe-business-practices-and-compliant-transfer\">In December 2023</a>, the Department of Justice joined with the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, State, and Treasury to issue a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/nsd/media/1328111/dl?inline=\">joint \u201cKnow Your Cargo\u201d compliance note</a> highlighting common tactics deployed by malign actors in the maritime and other transportation industries as well as recent enforcement actions taken in response to alleged violations.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Klimenka also allegedly controlled Soft-FX, a technology services company, and FX Open, a financial company.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges BTC-e was a significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity. BTC-e allegedly facilitated transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received criminal proceeds from numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings, and allegedly was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking. BTC-e\u2019s servers, maintained in the United States, were allegedly one of the primary ways in which BTC-e and its operators effectuated their scheme. Those servers were allegedly leased to and maintained by Klimenka and Soft-FX.</p>\n<p>Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e allegedly was not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate \u201cknow your customer\u201d or \u201cKYC\u201d verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Klimenka was arrested in Latvia on Dec. 21, 2023, at the request of the United States and made his initial appearance in San Francisco yesterday.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A Russian national was sentenced yesterday to five years and four months in prison for his involvement in developing and deploying the malicious software known as Trickbot, which was used to launch cyberattacks against American hospitals and other businesses.</p>\n<p>According to court documents and public reporting, Vladimir Dunaev, 40, of Amur Oblast, Russia, provided specialized services and technical abilities in furtherance of the Trickbot scheme. Trickbot, which was taken down in 2022, was a suite of malware tools designed to steal money and facilitate the installation of ransomware. Hospitals, schools, and businesses were among the millions of Trickbot victims who suffered tens of millions of dollars in losses. While active, Trickbot malware, which acted as an initial intrusion vector into victim computer systems, was used to support various ransomware variants.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sentencing demonstrates the department\u2019s ability to place cybercriminals behind bars, no matter where they are located,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cIn cooperation with our partners around the world, we will continue to bring cybercriminals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunaev developed malicious ransomware and deployed it to attack American hospitals, schools, and businesses in the Northern District of Ohio and throughout our country, all while hiding behind his computer,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Rebecca C. Lutzko for the Northern District of Ohio. \u201cHe and his co-defendants caused immeasurable disruption and financial damage, maliciously infecting millions of computers worldwide, and Dunaev will now spend over five years behind bars as a result. Dunaev\u2019s case demonstrates that the Justice Department and our office will use all available resources to investigate and prosecute cybercrime, and we thank our international partners for their cooperation in helping us stop cybercriminals like Dunaev and bring them to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dunaev developed browser modifications and malicious tools that aided in credential harvesting and datamining from infected computers, facilitated and enhanced the remote access used by Trickbot actors, and created a program code to prevent the Trickbot malware from being detected by legitimate security software. During Dunaev\u2019s participation in the scheme, 10 victims in the Northern District of Ohio, including Avon schools and a North Canton real-estate company, were defrauded of more than $3.4 million via ransomware deployed by Trickbot.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI relentlessly investigates criminal activity impacting the American people even when the perpetrators reside beyond our borders,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cCombating malicious cyber actors is a team sport, and we are proud of the coordinated effort that brought about this sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case and subsequent sentencing sends a strong message to cybercriminals and other bad actors who target individuals and businesses with malicious intent,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Greg Nelsen of the FBI Cleveland Field Office. \u201cThe complexities of this case required careful coordination among our domestic and international partners and their commitment to meticulous investigative work. I am proud of the synchronized effort to see that justice was served.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 2021, Dunaev was extradited from the Republic of Korea to the Northern District of Ohio. On Nov. 30, 2023, Dunaev pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.</p>\n<p>The original indictment returned in the Northern District of Ohio charged Dunaev and six other defendants for their alleged roles in developing, deploying, managing, and profiting from Trickbot.</p>\n<p>In June, one of Dunaev\u2019s co-conspirators, Alla Witte, who was a Trickbot malware developer and Latvian national, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1256\">February</a> and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1714\">September 2023</a>, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued financial sanctions against multiple suspected Trickbot members.</p>\n<p>The FBI Cleveland Field Office investigated the case.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Candy Heath of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Duncan Brown and Daniel Riedl for the Northern District of Ohio prosecuted the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and National Security Division, as well as the Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC, provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs worked with the International Criminal Affairs Division of the South Korean Ministry of Justice to secure the arrest and extradition of Dunaev.</p></div>",

Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0\u201cThrough this malign influence activity directed at the democratic processes of the United Kingdom, Russia again demonstrates its commitment to using weaponized campaigns of cyber espionage against such networks in unacceptable ways. The Department of Justice will respond to such behavior with an even more determined commitment to disrupt those activities and to hold accountable the individuals responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment is part of a coordinated international response to send a message to the conspirators that the whole of the United States government stands together and with our partners internationally to identify and disrupt cyber espionage actors, particularly those seeking to obtain government information and attempting to create chaos in democratic processes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cWe are grateful to all of our partners for their assistance in addressing these threats posed by the FSB\u2019s action in the Northern District of California, across the United States and around the world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will not stand idly by as Russia continues to perpetuate this type of targeted malicious activity,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cRussian interference through malign foreign influence campaigns is deplorable, and we will not tolerate it in the United States or directed against our foreign partners. The FBI is dedicated to combating this pervasive threat and will tirelessly seek to prevent and disrupt these criminal acts carried out by Russia.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment, which was unsealed today, alleges the conspiracy targeted current and former employees of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, Department of State, defense contractors, and Department of Energy facilities between at least October 2016 and October 2022. In addition, the indictment alleges the conspirators \u2013 known publicly by the name \u201cCallisto Group\u201d \u2013 targeted military and government officials, think tank researchers and staff, and journalists in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and that information from certain of these targeted accounts was leaked to the press in Russia and the United Kingdom in advance of U.K. elections in 2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a common example, the conspirators used \u201cspoofed\u201d email accounts designed to look like personal and work-related email accounts of the group\u2019s targets. The conspirators allegedly also sent sophisticated looking emails that appeared to be from email providers suggesting users had violated terms of service. These messages were designed to trick victims into providing their email account credentials to false login prompts. Once the conspirators fraudulently obtained the victim\u2019s credentials, they were able to use those credentials to access the victims\u2019 email accounts at will.</p>\n<p>In addition to the indictment, the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1962\">Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a> announced that it has sanctioned both Peretyatko and Korinets for their roles in malicious cyber-enabled activity. Moreover, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-exposes-attempted-russian-cyber-interference-in-politics-and-democratic-processes\">United Kingdom has issued sanctions</a> of its own, and the U.S. Department of State announced rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of <a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/ruslan-aleksandrovich-peretyatko/\">Peretyatko</a> and <a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/andrey-stanislavovich-korinets/\">Korinets</a>, as well as their conspirators.</p>\n<p>In addition to the name \u201cCallisto Group,\u201d FSB Center 18 is known by cybersecurity investigators as \u201cDancing Salome\u201d by Kaspersky Labs, \u201cSTAR BLIZZARD\u201d by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center and \u201cCOLDRIVER\u201d by Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group.</p>\n<p>The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, namely, computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison for PERETYATKO, and up to 10 years for KORINETS. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, the National Security Cyber Section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and the FBI San Francisco Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s, and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world provided essential support.

Lutzko for the Northern District of Ohio. \u201cDunaev and his codefendants hid behind their keyboards, first to create Trickbot, then using it to infect millions of computers worldwide \u2014 including those used by hospitals, schools, and businesses \u2014 invading privacy and causing untold disruption and financial damage. The Justice Department and our office have prioritized investigating and prosecuting cybercrime, and today\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates our willingness to reach across the globe to bring cybercriminals to justice. We will continue to work closely with our partners, foreign and domestic, and use all resources at our disposal to stop similar behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCombating bad actors in cyberspace is a team sport, and we are proud of the collaboration and coordination at the international level that went into today\u2019s plea,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThe FBI will pursue criminals who target the American people with malware no matter where they reside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the world of technology is ever-changing, cybercrime continues to evolve. This case underscores the FBI\u2019s relentless pursuit of cyber criminals and highlights our expertise to find and dismantle criminal networks,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Gregory Nelsen of the FBI Cleveland Field Office. \u201cWe appreciate the coordinated work among our public and private sector global colleagues together with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to further protect the public from destructive malware.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2021, Dunaev was extradited from the Republic of Korea to the Northern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p>Dunaev pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 20, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison on both counts. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The original indictment returned in the Northern District of Ohio charged Dunaev and eight other defendants for their alleged roles in developing, deploying, managing, and profiting from Trickbot.</p>\n<p>In June, one of Dunaev\u2019s co-conspirators, Alla Witte, who was a Trickbot malware developer and Latvian national, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison.</p>\n<p>In February and September, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued financial sanctions against multiple suspected Trickbot members.</p>\n<p>The FBI Cleveland Field Office is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Candy Heath of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Duncan Brown and Daniel Riedl for the Northern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and National Security Division, as well as the Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC, provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs worked with the International Criminal Affairs Division of the South Korean Ministry of Justice to secure the arrest and extradition of Dunaev.</p></div>",

The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) completed the removal of Krstic on Oct. 30 from Georgia to the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p>Krstic arrived in the Northern District of Texas made his initial appearance today in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where he will first face charges before being transferred to face additional charges in the Eastern District of New York.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis extradition is the result of continued coordination between the Justice Department and our Georgian law enforcement partners in the fight against transnational organized crime,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWe are committed to protecting the people of this nation by investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in cryptocurrency fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><u>Northern District of Texas</u></strong></p>\n<p>In March 2020, a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas indicted Krstic for his role in defrauding investors worldwide out of more than $70 million through fraudulent cryptocurrency and binary options investment platforms. Krstic and more than a dozen other alleged fraudsters were also indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the superseding indictment in July 2020.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe work on this case exemplifies the whole of the Justice Department to bring cyber-criminals \u2013 including those who use cryptocurrency and other purported cyber investment platforms to victimize the citizens of the United States \u2013 to justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton for the Northern District of Texas. \u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas will work hand-in-hand with our law enforcement partners to ensure that cyber-criminals are held accountable regardless of their location.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the defendants allegedly helped create and market more than 20 fraudulent cryptocurrency and binary options investment platforms, including Start Options, Trinity Mining, Hedger Tech, BTC Mining Factory, Bitcoin Trading World, Dragon Mining, BTC Trader Online, Crypto Trading World, Go Solar Mining, BTC Falcon, Perpetual Energy, Perfect-Options, Options Rider, Option Giants, Banking Options, Aeon Options, Bancde Options, Instant Options, Fast Options, and Elite Options.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI remains committed to pursuing subjects across international boundaries who are increasingly utilizing sophisticated virtual asset schemes to defraud investors,\u201d said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cVictims were told their investment in Start Options and B2G would return significant wealth, but many were defrauded and harmed as a result. The FBI thanks our national and international partners for their efforts throughout the investigation to help bring justice for the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis extradition occurred because of international cooperation and the FBI\u2019s persistence to hold this individual accountable for defrauding thousands of innocent victims. Some victims lost their entire savings to this scheme and have not been able to financially recover,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Chad Yarbrough of the FBI Dallas Field Office. \u201cWe would like to thank our international partners for assisting us with the arrest and extradition of Mr. Krstic. He will now finally face charges for his actions in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>Krstic is charged in the Northern District of Texas with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in an alleged scheme to create, promote, market, and organize fraudulent online investment platforms. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count.</p>\n<p>The FBI Dallas Field Office is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Winters and Nicole Dana for the Northern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dimitri Rocha and John de la Garza for the Northern District of Texas assisted with forfeiture matters.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Eastern District of New York</u></strong></p>\n<p>In February 2021, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of New York also indicted Krstic for his role in a cryptocurrency scheme in which he solicited U.S. investors using two fraudulent online investment platforms.\u00a0According to court documents, Krstic was the founder of two digital-asset investment platforms, Start Options and B2G, and also served as the chief financial officer of Start Options. As alleged, between approximately 2017 and 2018, Krstic and others fraudulently induced U.S.-based investors to purchase securities in the form of investment contracts in Start Options and B2G. To perpetuate the fraud, Krstic allegedly used the alias \u201cFelix Logan\u201d and created the Twitter handle \u201c@felixlogan_cfo\u201d to communicate with investors in Start Options and B2G.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Start Options purported to be an online investment platform that provided cryptocurrency mining and digital-asset trading services, including trading in cryptocurrencies, commodities, stocks, and indices. Start Options also allegedly claimed that it was \u201cthe largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity\u201d and that it was \u201cconsistently rated the best and most secure Bitcoin exchange by independent news media.\u201d The indictment further alleges that B2G purported to be an \u201cecosystem\u201d that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, as well as digital and fiat currencies, \u201con a secure, comprehensive platform.\u201d Krstic and others allegedly represented that once investors opened a B2G account, a deposit of B2G \u201copen[ed] a door to all the curtains inside Aladdin\u2019s cave. Dollars buy B2G; B2G tokens can be exchanged back into dollars, or for Euros, or for other national fiat currencies.\u00a0 B2G holdings can be traded for original bitcoin or other altcoins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKristijan Krstic used the hype and mystery of cryptocurrency to separate unwitting investors from their money,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cKrstic founded two online investment platforms which allowed him to steal $7 million in investor funds before closing up shop. Fleeing the country did not stop IRS-CI and our law enforcement partners from continuing our pursuit of justice, and today\u2019s extraction demonstrates that no criminal is out of our reach.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, however, the money that investors in Start Options and B2G sent was never invested and instead, was laundered internationally to a Philippines-based financial account and digital-currency wallet and diverted to John DeMarr, a U.S.-based promoter of the fraud. Subsequently, DeMarr allegedly transferred to Krstic approximately $7 million in investor funds from B2G and Start Options, and then Krstic stopped responding to all communications and absconded with those investors\u2019 funds. A press release issued by Start Options claimed that the company had been sold to Russian venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>Krstic is charged in the Eastern District of New York with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 31, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/us-promoter-foreign-cryptocurrency-companies-sentenced-60-months-prison-his-role-multi\">DeMarr</a>, 55, of Santa Ana, California, the former Director of North American Operations for Start Options and B2G, was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the scheme.</p>\n<p>U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York joined in the announcement.</p>\n<p>IRS-CI and the FBI Los Angeles Field Office are investigating the case. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The government of Georgia, including the Prosecution Service of Georgia, Ministry of Justice of Georgia, and the Ministry of Interior of Georgia, provided significant assistance in the extradition of Krstic to the United States. Republika Srpska Police (RS-MUP) assisted as well. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Krstic. USMS transported Krstic from Georgia to the United States.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Tian Huang of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kaitlin Farrell, Hiral Mehta, and David Pitluck for Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case, with assistance on forfeiture matters from Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Mantell for the Eastern District of New York.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

The indictment alleges that, as part of the scheme, Richardson created false records to make it appear as though the individuals were employed as Certified Nursing Assistants, when in fact they were not working at the nursing home. The indictment further alleges that Richardson logged false hours for these \u201cghost\u201d employees, which caused the nursing home to issue paychecks. According to the indictment, some \u201cghost\u201d employees cashed the checks and shared the proceeds with Richardson. The indictment further alleges that on other occasions Richardson forged endorsement signatures for the individuals and deposited the paychecks into her own bank accounts. As a result of the scheme, the nursing home paid out over $100,000 for work that was never performed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese charges reflect the department\u2019s commitment to hold criminals accountable for their wrongdoing,\u201d said Principal Deputy Attorney General Brian M.

According to the FBI, in 2021, Conti ransomware was used to attack more critical infrastructure victims than any other ransomware variant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department has taken action against individuals we allege developed and deployed a dangerous malware scheme used in cyberattacks on American school districts, local governments, and financial institutions,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cSeparately, we have also taken action against individuals we allege are behind one of the most prolific ransomware variants used in cyberattacks across the United States, including attacks on local police departments and emergency medical services. These actions should serve as a warning to cybercriminals who target America\u2019s critical infrastructure that they cannot hide from the United States Department of Justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows our ongoing commitment to bringing the most heinous cyber criminals to justice \u2013 those who have devoted themselves to inflicting harm on the American public, our hospitals, schools, and businesses,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cCyber criminals know that we will use every lawful tool at our disposal to identify them, tirelessly pursue them, and disrupt their criminal activity. We, alongside our federal and international partners, will continue to impose costs through joint operations no matter where these criminals may attempt to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants charged in these three indictments across three different jurisdictions allegedly used their cyber knowledge and capabilities to victimize people and businesses around the world without regard for the damage they caused,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese indictments should serve as a reminder that no matter a cybercriminal\u2019s location, we will identify and pursue them by doing everything in our power to ensure they face the consequences of their actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConti ransomware was used to exploit our financial systems and target hundreds of innocent victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge William Mancino of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThe Secret Service will continue to work with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to investigate cybercriminals and bring offenders to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>As detailed below, a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Ohio returned an indictment charging Maksim Galochkin, aka Bentley; Maksim Rudenskiy, aka Buza; Mikhail Mikhailovich Tsarev, aka Mango; Andrey Yuryevich Zhuykov, aka Defender; Dmitry Putilin, aka Grad and Staff; Sergey Loguntsov, aka Begemot and Zulas; Max Mikhaylov, aka Baget; Valentin Karyagin, aka Globus; and Maksim Khaliullin, aka Maxfax, Maxhax, and Kagas, all Russian nationals, with conspiring to use the Trickbot malware to steal money and personal and confidential information from unsuspecting victims, including businesses and financial institutions located in the United States and around the world, beginning in November 2015.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury in the Middle District of Tennessee returned an indictment charging Galochkin, Rudenskiy, Tsarev, and Zhuykov with conspiring to use Conti ransomware to attack businesses, nonprofits, and governments in the United States beginning in 2020 and continuing through June 2022.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury in the Southern District of California returned an indictment charging Galochkin in connection with the Conti ransomware attack on Scripps Health on May 1, 2021.</p>\n<p><em><u>Northern District of Ohio</u></em></p>\n<p>The indictment returned in the Northern District of Ohio charged all nine defendants for their alleged roles in developing, deploying, managing, and profiting from the malware known as Trickbot. Trickbot was a sophisticated, modular, multi-functional suite of malware tools which (a) infected victims\u2019 computers with malware designed to capture victims\u2019 online banking login credentials; (b)\u00a0obtained and harvested other personal identification information, including credit cards, emails, passwords, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses; (c) infected other computers connected to the victim computer; (d) used the captured login credentials to fraudulently gain unauthorized access to victims\u2019 online bank accounts at financial institutions; (e) stole funds from victims\u2019 bank accounts and laundered those funds using U.S. and foreign beneficiary bank accounts provided and controlled by the defendants and co-conspirators; and (f) installed ransomware on victim computers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Trickbot infected millions of computers worldwide, including those used by hospitals, schools, and businesses,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Rebecca C. Lutzko for the Northern District of Ohio. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates that these dangerous cybercriminals are not anonymous, as they once believed. The indictments unsealed today show the resolve of the international community to work together to bring cybercriminals to justice. We will continue to use all resources at our disposal to stop cybercrime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each defendant is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, one count of wire fraud conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the scheme. The indictment also included an enhancement for falsely registering domains. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of 62 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Trickbot malware developers Alla Witte and\u00a0Vladimir Dunaev were previously indicted and apprehended. Witte, a Latvian national pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and was sentenced to 32 months in June 2023. Dunaev, a Russian national, currently is in custody and pending trial in Cleveland.</p>\n<p><em><u>Middle District of Tennessee</u></em></p>\n<p>The Middle District of Tennessee indictment charges that the individuals behind Conti ransomware, including Galochkin, Rudenskiy, Tsarev, and Zhuykov, conspired to use Conti to attack hundreds of victims. Conti\u2019s victims included hospital systems, local governments, and foreign governments. Conti conspirators allegedly extorted funds from victims in the Middle District of Tennessee and encrypted the computer systems of a local sheriff\u2019s department, a local police department, and local emergency medical services, among others. Ransom notes left on Conti victims\u2019 computer systems typically boasted \u201cif you don\u2019t [know Conti] \u2013 just \u2018google it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe conspirators who developed and deployed Conti ransomware victimized businesses, governments, and non-profits around the world, including a sheriff\u2019s office and an emergency medical service in Tennessee,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Henry C. Leventis for the Middle District of Tennessee. \u201cWe will continue to use the full power of this office to ensure that hackers can no longer hide behind their computer screens and to hold them accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Galochkin was a \u201ccrypter\u201d for Conti, modifying the ransomware so that it would not be detected by anti-virus programs; Rudenskiy was a developer who supervised other Conti developers; Tsarev was a manager of other Conti conspirators; and Zhuykov was a systems administrator who managed users of Conti infrastructure, organized and paid for infrastructure and tools, and assisted in problem solving infrastructure-related issues.</p>\n<p>Galochkin, Rudenskiy, Tsarev, and Zhuykov are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and one count wire fraud conspiracy. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.</p>\n<p><em><u>Southern District of California</u></em></p>\n<p>As alleged in the Southern District of California indictment, Galochkin caused the transmission of the Conti malware and impaired the medical examination, diagnosis, treatment, and care of one or more individuals.</p>\n<p>Galochkin is charged with three counts of computer hacking. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment alleges a callous disregard for the medical care and the personal information of residents of the Southern District of California,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew R. Haden for the Southern District of California. \u201cThis office is committed to protecting victims of cybercrime and holding perpetrators accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The FBI Cleveland Field Office is leading the investigation into Trickbot malware.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Riedl and Duncan Brown for the Northern District of Ohio and Senior Counsel Candina Heath of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the Trickbot malware case.</p>\n<p>The FBI San Diego, Memphis, and El Paso Field Offices, with U.S. Secret Service, are leading the investigation into Conti ransomware. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Taylor J.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A Russian national and a Washington man were charged today with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, unsealed today in the Southern District of New York, Roman Storm, 34, of Auburn, Washington, and Roman Semenov, 49, of Russia, created, operated, and promoted Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer that facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering transactions, and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercrime organization. Storm was arrested today in the state of Washington and will be presented later today in the Western District of Washington.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, the defendants operated a $1 billion scheme designed to help other criminals launder and conceal funds using cryptocurrency, including by laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of a state-sponsored North Korean cybercrime group sanctioned by the U.S. government,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThese charges should serve as yet another warning to those who think they can turn to cryptocurrency to conceal their crimes and hide their identities, including cryptocurrency mixers: it does not matter how sophisticated your scheme is or how many attempts you have made to anonymize yourself, the Justice Department will find you and hold you accountable for your crimes.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement should remind criminal organizations everywhere in the world that they are neither untraceable nor anonymous,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from us behind a keyboard \u2014 whether you\u2019re a hacker or facilitator. Those charged today engaged in a conspiracy to launder money for cybercriminals, including for a North Korean cybercrime organization seeking to evade sanctions. As we have with this operation, the FBI is going to keep dismantling the infrastructure used by cyber criminals to commit and profit from their crimes, and holding anyone who assists those criminals accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCryptocurrency mixers have become the go-to method for criminals to conceal their ill-gotten gains. As alleged, the defendants operated Tornado Cash as a safe haven for criminal actors to obfuscate the trail of funds tied to their criminal activities, such as computer hacking and wire fraud,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe Criminal Division will continue to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of those who seek to criminally exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs stated in the indictment, the defendants\u2019 cryptocurrency service facilitated more than $1 billion in illicit transactions and they knowingly allowed a globally sanctioned cybercrime group to launder hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of the North Korean regime,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe Justice Department \u2013 alongside our domestic and international law enforcement partners \u2013 will use every tool in our arsenal to pursue and dismantle the criminal networks that enable U.S. sanctions violations wherever they operate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Tornado Cash was an infamous cryptocurrency mixer that laundered more than one billion dollars in criminal proceeds and violated U.S. sanctions,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cRoman Storm and Roman Semenov allegedly operated Tornado Cash and knowingly facilitated this money laundering. While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes. Today\u2019s indictment is a reminder that money laundering through cryptocurrency transactions violates the law, and those who engage in such laundering will face prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Storm and Semenov were two of the three founders of the Tornado Cash service, a cryptocurrency mixer that allowed its customers to engage in untraceable transfers of cryptocurrency. The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly created the core features of the Tornado Cash service, paid for critical infrastructure to operate the Tornado Cash service, promoted the Tornado Cash service, and made millions of dollars in profits from operating the Tornado Cash service. The Tornado Cash service advertised to customers that it provided untraceable and anonymous financial transactions, and Storm and Semenov chose not to implement know-your customer or anti-money laundering programs as required by law. As a result, the Tornado Cash service was used to launder more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. Storm and Semenov allegedly knew about these money laundering transactions and received complaints and requests for help from victims of hacking and other cybercrimes. However, they refused to implement any controls and continued to operate the Tornado Cash service and facilitate these money laundering transactions.</p>\n<p>In April and May 2022, the Tornado Cash service was allegedly used by the Lazarus Group, a sanctioned North Korean cybercrime organization, to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in hacking proceeds. Storm and Semenov allegedly knew that the Tornado Cash service they were operating was engaging in these sanctions-violating transactions. They implemented a change in the service so they could make a public announcement that they were compliant with sanctions, but in their private chats they agreed that this change would be ineffective. They then continued to operate the Tornado Cash service and facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars in further sanctions-violating transactions, helping the Lazarus Group to transfer criminal proceeds from a cryptocurrency wallet that had been designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as blocked property.</p>\n<p>Storm and Semenov are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. They are also each charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI and the IRS-Criminal Investigation are investigating the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thane Rehn and Benjamin Gianforti for the Southern District of New York, and\u00a0Trial Attorneys Jacques Singer-Emery and Garrett Coyle of the Justice Department's National Security Division are prosecuting the case in partnership with the Criminal Division\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET).</p>\n<p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that enable the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also sets strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identifies areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and leads the Department\u2019s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Through LolekHosted, Grabowski provided \u201cbulletproof\u201d webhosting services, which is secure webhosting designed to facilitate malicious and criminal activities, including ransomware, brute-force attacks, and phishing. Grabowski allegedly facilitated the criminal activities of LolekHosted clients by allowing clients to register accounts using false information, not maintaining Internet Protocol (IP) address logs of client servers, frequently changing the IP addresses of client servers, ignoring abuse complaints made by third parties against clients, and notifying clients of legal inquiries received from law enforcement. Grabowski registered the domain \u201cLolekHosted.net\u201d in 2014, and advertised that its services were \u201cbulletproof,\u201d provided \u201c100% privacy hosting,\u201d and allowed clients to host \u201ceverything except child porn.\u201d</p>\n<p>The NetWalker ransomware was one of the ransomware variants facilitated by LolekHosted. The NetWalker ransomware was deployed on approximately 400 victim company networks, including municipalities, hospitals, law enforcement and emergency services, school districts, colleges, and universities, which resulted in the payment of more than 5,000 bitcoin in ransoms (currently valued at approximately $146 million). LolekHosted clients used its services to execute approximately 50 NetWalker ransomware attacks on victims located all over the world, including in the Middle District of Florida. Specifically, clients used the servers of LolekHosted as intermediaries when gaining unauthorized access to victim networks, and to store hacking tools and data stolen from victims.</p>\n<p>On Aug. 8, U.S. authorities seized LolekHosted.net, the domain name LolekHosted used for nearly a decade.

Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe Department of Justice\u00a0will continue to use every tool in our arsenal to counter threats from China and to deter those who aid them in breaking our laws and threatening our national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese arrests are a reminder of the relentless, aggressive efforts of the People\u2019s Republic of China to undermine our democracy and threaten those who defend it,\u201d said Assistant Director Suzanne Turner of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe PRC compromised enlisted personnel to secure sensitive military information that could seriously jeopardize U.S. national security. The FBI and our partners remain vigilant in our determination to combat espionage, and encourage past and present government officials to report any suspicious interactions with suspected foreign intelligence officers.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><u>United States v. Jinchao Wei, Southern District of California</u></em></p>\n<p>A U.S. Navy sailor, Jinchao Wei, aka Patrick Wei, was arrested yesterday on espionage charges as he arrived for work at Naval Base San Diego, the homeport of the Pacific Fleet. He was indicted for conspiracy to send national defense information to an intelligence officer working for the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p>\n<p>The indictment, unsealed this morning, alleges that Wei, was an active-duty sailor on the amphibious assault ship the U.S.S. Essex stationed at Naval Base San Diego. In his role as a machinist\u2019s mate, Wei held a U.S. security clearance and had access to sensitive national defense information about the ship\u2019s weapons, propulsion and desalination systems. Amphibious assault ships like the Essex resemble small aircraft carriers and allow the U.S. military to project power and maintain presence by serving as the cornerstone of the U.S. Navy\u2019s amphibious readiness and expeditionary strike capabilities.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, in February 2022, Wei began communicating with an intelligence officer from the PRC who requested that Wei provide information about the U.S.S. Essex and other Navy ships. Specifically, the Chinese intelligence officer tasked Wei with passing him photos, videos and documents concerning U.S. Navy ships and their systems. The two agreed to hide their communications by deleting records of their conversations and using encrypted methods of communication.</p>\n<p>At the request of the intelligence officer, between March 2022 and the present, Wei sent photographs and videos of the Essex, disclosed the locations of various Navy ships and described defensive weapons of the Essex. In exchange for this information, the intelligence officer paid Wei thousands of dollars over the course of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that in June 2022, Wei sent the intelligence officer approximately 30 technical and mechanical manuals. These manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships, including power, steering, aircraft and deck elevators, as well as damage and casualty controls. The intelligence officer confirmed with Wei that at least 10 of those manuals were useful to him. For passage of those materials, the indictment alleges that Wei was paid $5,000.</p>\n<p>In June 2022, the intelligence officer requested that Wei provide information about the number and training of U.S. Marines during an upcoming international maritime warfare exercise. In response to this request, Wei sent multiple photographs of military equipment to the intelligence officer.</p>\n<p>In August 2022, Wei sent an additional 26 technical and mechanical manuals related to the power structure and operation of the Essex and similar ships. The manuals contained warnings that this was technical data subject to export controls and that it was deemed \u201ccritical technology\u201d by the U.S. Navy.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that in October 2022, Wei sent a technical manual to the intelligence officer describing the layout and location of certain departments, including berthing quarters and weapons systems. Specifically, Wei sent a weapons control systems manual for the Essex and similar ships. This manual contained export-controlled data that could not be exported without a license from the U.S. government. The indictment alleges that Wei knowingly violated the International Traffic in Arms Regulations by transmitting this manual to the Chinese intelligence officer without obtaining a required license.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The intelligence officer continued to request information in 2023, including information about the overhaul and upgrades to the Essex. Specifically, he requested blueprints, especially those related to modifications to the flight deck. Wei provided information related to the repairs the Essex was undergoing, as well as other mechanical problems with similar vessels.</p>\n<p>During the alleged conspiracy, the intelligence officer instructed Wei to gather U.S. military information that was not public and admonished him not to discuss their relationship and to destroy any evidence regarding the nature of their relationship and their activities.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have entrusted members of our military with tremendous responsibility and great faith,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman for the Southern District of California. \u201cOur nation\u2019s safety and security are in their hands. When a soldier or sailor chooses cash over country, and hands over national defense information in an ultimate act of betrayal, the United States will aggressively investigate and prosecute.\u201d</p>\n<p>U.S. Attorney Grossman thanked the prosecution team and investigating agencies for their excellent work on this case.</p>\n<p>The FBI and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigated the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Parmley and Fred Sheppard for the Southern District of California and Trial Attorney Adam Barry of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em><u>United States v. Wenheng Zhao, Central District of California</u></em></p>\n<p>A U.S. Navy servicemember, Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao, aka Thomas Zhao, 26, of Monterey Park, California, was arrested following an indictment by a federal grand jury, charging him with receiving bribes in exchange for transmitting sensitive U.S. military information to an individual posing as a maritime economic researcher, but who was actually an intelligence officer from the PRC.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Zhao, who worked at Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme and held a U.S. security clearance, received bribes from a Chinese intelligence officer in exchange for violating his official duties as a U.S. sailor by, among other actions, disclosing non-public sensitive U.S. military information.<u> </u></p>\n<p>Beginning in August 2021 and continuing through at least May 2023, at the Chinese intelligence officer\u2019s direction, Zhao allegedly violated his official duties to protect sensitive military information by surreptitiously recording, and then transmitting to the intelligence officer, U.S. military information, photographs and videos. According to the indictment, the Chinese intelligence officer told Zhao that the intelligence officer was a maritime economic researcher seeking the information for investment decisions.</p>\n<p>In exchange for bribes, Zhao allegedly sent the Chinese military officer non-public and controlled operational plans for a large-scale U.S. military exercise in the Indo-Pacific Region, which detailed the specific location and timing of Naval force movements, amphibious landings, maritime operations and logistics support.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that in exchange for bribes, Zhao also photographed electrical diagrams and blueprints for a radar system stationed on a U.S. military base in Okinawa, Japan.</p>\n<p>The intelligence officer allegedly directed Zhao to conceal their relationship and to destroy evidence of the unlawful and corrupt scheme.</p>\n<p>In exchange for the sensitive information Zhao provided \u2013 information Zhao accessed as a result of his position within the U.S. Navy \u2013 the Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao approximately $14,866, the indictment alleges.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy sending this sensitive military information to an intelligence officer employed by a hostile foreign state, the defendant betrayed his sacred oath to protect our country and uphold the Constitution,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central District of California. \u201cUnlike the vast majority of U.S. Navy personnel who serve the nation with honor, distinction and courage, Mr. Zhao chose to corruptly sell out his colleagues and his country.\u201d</p>\n<p>If convicted, Zhao faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI Los Angeles Field Office\u2019s Counterintelligence and Cyber Division and NCIS investigated the case. IRS Criminal Investigation provided substantial assistance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Annamartine Salick, Sarah Gerdes, Christine Ro and Kathrynne Seiden of the Terrorism and Export Crimes Section for the Central District of California are prosecuting this case. Trial Attorney Adam Barry of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section is providing substantial assistance.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

One defendant, Oluwasegun Baiyewu, was previously charged on Oct. 21, 2021.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Oluwaseun Adelekan 40, and Temitope Omotayo, 40, both of Staten Island, New York; Ifeoluwa Dudubo, 37, of Austin, Texas; and Temitope Suleiman, 37, and Oluwasegun Baiyewu, 37, of Richmond, Texas, conspired to launder funds from different international organized fraud schemes, including romance, pandemic relief unemployment insurance fraud, and business email compromise scams. These fraud schemes disproportionately impacted elderly or otherwise vulnerable Americans.</p>\n<p>\u201cFraud that targets seniors is reprehensible, and money laundering networks like the one alleged in this case allow fraudsters to profit from their unlawful schemes,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

After receiving the proceeds, the defendants or their co-conspirators conducted hundreds of transactions with the funds, including by obtaining cashier\u2019s checks and money orders, and then using the cashier\u2019s checks and money orders to purchase used cars that were shipped overseas to Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Adelekan, Baiyewu, Dudubo, Omotayo, and Suleiman are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

LockBit actors have executed over 1,400 attacks against victims in the United States and around the world, issuing over $100 million in ransom demands and receiving at least as much as tens of millions of dollars in actual ransom payments made in the form of bitcoin.</p>\n<p>In furtherance of his LockBit-related activities, Astamirov owned, controlled, and used a variety of email addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and other online provider accounts that allowed him and his co-conspirators to deploy LockBit ransomware and to communicate with their victims. Additionally, in at least one circumstance, law enforcement was able to trace a portion of a victim\u2019s ransom payment to a virtual currency address in Astamirov\u2019s control.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is committed to pursuing ransomware actors like Astamirov, who have exploited vulnerable cyber ecosystems and harmed victims,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cWe, in collaboration with our federal and international partners, are fully committed to\u00a0the permanent dismantlement of these types of ransomware campaigns that intentionally target people and our private sector partners. We will continue to leverage every resource to prevent this type of malicious, criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Astamirov is charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud and conspiring to intentionally damage protected computers and to transmit ransom demands. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the first charge and a maximum penalty of five years in prison on the second charge. Both charges are also punishable by a maximum fine of either $250,000 or twice the gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest.</p>\n<p>This announcement follows LockBit-related charges in two other cases from the District of New Jersey. In November 2022, the department announced criminal charges against <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-participation-lockbit-global-ransomware-campaign\">Mikhail Vasiliev</a>, a dual Russian and Canadian national, who is currently in custody in Canada awaiting extradition to the United States. In May 2023, the department announced the indictment of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-ransomware-attacks-against-critical-infrastructure\">Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev</a>, aka Wazawaka, aka m1x, aka Boriselcin, aka Uhodiransomwar, for his alleged participation in separate conspiracies to deploy LockBit, Babuk, and Hive ransomware variants against victims in the United States and abroad.</p>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office\u2019s Cyber Crimes Task Force is investigating the case. The Jersey City Police Department, New Jersey State Police, Newark IRS Criminal Investigation, and the international partners from Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre, Eurojust, National Police Agency of Japan, France\u2019s Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command (Cyber Crime Investigation Unit / C3N), National Crime Agency and South West Regional Organized Crime Unit of the United Kingdom, Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich of Switzerland, Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein and the Bundeskriminalamt of Germany, and Swedish Police Authority of Sweden also provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Jessica C. Peck and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, Vinay Limbachia, and David E. Malagold for the District of New Jersey\u2019s Cybercrime Unit in Newark are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Victims of LockBit ransomware should contact their local FBI field office and visit StopRansomware.gov for further information.</p>\n<p><em>A criminal complaint is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department unsealed charges related to the 2011 hack of the cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and the operation of the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, both Russian nationals, are charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. Bilyuchenko is also charged with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis announcement marks an important milestone in two major cryptocurrency investigations. As alleged in the indictments, starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange\u2019s ultimate insolvency. Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese indictments highlight the department\u2019s unwavering commitment to bring to justice bad actors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and prevent the abuse of the financial system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs cyber criminals have become more sophisticated in their methods of thievery, our career prosecutors and law enforcement partners, too, have become experts in the latest technologies being abused for malicious purposes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAs alleged, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, a novel technology at the time, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals, no matter how complex their schemes, until they are brought to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators allegedly operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2013 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2013 to launder billions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. \u201cThe Department of Justice will work tirelessly to identify cyber criminals, no matter where they are. And Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will learn that the Department of Justice has long arms and an even longer memory for crimes that harm our communities.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Southern District of New York indictment</em></p>\n<p>According to court documents unsealed in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), in or about September 2011, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly gained unauthorized access to the server holding the cryptocurrency wallets for Mt. Gox. At the time, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in existence, servicing thousands of users worldwide. Mt. Gox stored the cryptocurrency wallets containing its customers\u2019 bitcoin, and the corresponding private keys used to authorize bitcoin transfers from those wallets, on a computer server in Japan.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will continue to work with our U.S. government and international partners to relentlessly pursue and disrupt malicious cyber actors wherever they may reside,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWhen cyber criminals engage in fraudulent activity, such as hacking and illicitly operating cryptocurrency exchanges, it is critical that we impose cost on the bad actors and ensure they face justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly used their unauthorized access to Mt. Gox\u2019s server to fraudulently cause bitcoin to be transferred from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. From September 2011 through at least May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly caused the theft of at least approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox, representing the vast majority of the bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox\u2019s customers. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered the bulk of the bitcoins stolen through Mt. Gox principally through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators controlled at two other online bitcoin exchanges.</p>\n<p>\u201cCryptocurrency offers a new way for criminals to steal and launder money, but greed and deceit are nothing new,\u201d said Chief Jim Lee of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). \u201cIRS-CI is specially equipped to follow the complex financial trail left by criminals, and we are dedicated to holding those accountable for crimes committed. IRS-CI is proud to stand with our law enforcement partners to announce this indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p>In furtherance of the money laundering scheme, in or about April 2012, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly negotiated and entered into a fraudulent contract (the \u201cAdvertising Contract\u201d) to provide purported advertising services to a Bitcoin brokerage service based in the Southern District of New York (the \u201cNew York Bitcoin Broker\u201d). Under the guise of the Advertising Contract, in order to conceal and liquidate the bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko and Verner allegedly made regular requests to the owner and operator of the New York Bitcoin Broker to make large wire transfers into various offshore bank accounts, including in the names of shell corporations, controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. In accordance with these requests, between in or about March 2012 and in or about April 2013, the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly transferred more than approximately $6.6 million to overseas bank accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. In exchange for the wire transfers, the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly received \u201ccredit\u201d on Exchange-1, through which Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered more than 300,000 of the bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox.\u00a0 The fraudulent Advertising Contract with the New York Bitcoin Broker allegedly enabled Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators to conceal and liquidate bitcoins stolen through the Mt. Gox Hack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mt. Gox ceased operations in 2014 after the theft was revealed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Northern District of California indictment</em></p>\n<p>According to court documents unsealed in the Northern District of California (NDCA), Bilyuchenko allegedly worked with Vinnik and others to operate the BTC-e exchange from 2011 until it was shut down by law enforcement in July 2017. During that time period, BTC-e was one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges and was one of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.</p>\n<p>BTC-e served over one million users worldwide, moving millions of bitcoin worth of deposits and withdrawals, and processing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions. BTC-e received criminal proceeds of numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Secret Service has a long tradition of pursuing and bringing to justice those who aim to exploit our financial systems and target innocent victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge William Mancino of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cWorking together with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners, we will continue to investigate criminal organizations that operate in the ever-evolving cyber domain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) continues to investigate cyber criminals illicitly operating in virtual spaces, and we are proud to have worked collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to bring these two individuals to justice,\u201d said Acting Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of HSI. \u201cOur special agents continue to investigate transnational criminal organizations operating in emerging technologies, leveraging our broad authorities to identify, and dismantle those behind sophisticated crypto-scams.\u201d</p>\n<p>The SDNY indictment charges Bilyuchenko and Verner with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The NDCA indictment charges Bilyuchenko with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money services business.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit is handling the SDNY case. The FBI and IRS-CI are investigating the case and SDNY Assistant U.S. Attorney Olga I. Zverovich is prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The Corporate and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) are handling the NDCA case. The FBI; IRS-CI Oakland Field Office and Cyber Crime Unit in Washington, D.C.; U.S. Secret Service Criminal Investigative Division; and HSI are investigating the case. CCIPS Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker and NDCA Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Quiroz, both members of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, and NDCA Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Lloyd-Lovett are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided invaluable assistance.</p>\n<p><em>A criminal indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department today announced criminal charges in five cases and four arrests from five different U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in connection with the recently launched multi-agency Disruptive Technology Strike Force.</p>\n<p>The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce to counter efforts by hostile nation-states to illicitly acquire sensitive U.S. technology to advance their authoritarian regimes and facilitate human rights abuses. The Strike Force\u2019s work has led to the unsealing of charges against multiple defendants in five cases accused of crimes including export violations, smuggling and theft of trade secrets.</p>\n<p>Two of these cases involve the disruption of alleged procurement networks created to help the Russian military and intelligence services obtain sensitive technology in violation of U.S. laws. In the Eastern District of New York, a Greek national was arrested on May 9 for federal crimes in connection with allegedly acquiring more than 10 different types of sensitive technologies on behalf of the Russian government and serving as a procurement agent for two Russian Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) operating on behalf of Russia\u2019s intelligence services. In the District of Arizona, two Russian nationals were arrested for their involvement in a procurement scheme to supply multiple Russian commercial airline companies \u2013 which were subject to bans from engaging in certain type of commercial transactions \u2013 with export-controlled parts and components, including braking technology.</p>\n<p>Two of the other cases announced today charge former software engineers with stealing software and hardware source code from U.S. tech companies in order to market it to Chinese competitors. In the Central District of California, a senior software engineer was arrested on May 5 for theft of trade secrets for allegedly stealing source code used in metrology software which is used in \u201csmart\u201d automotive manufacturing equipment. The defendant then allegedly marketed the stolen technology to multiple Chinese companies. In the Northern District of California, a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and former Apple engineer is accused of allegedly stealing thousands of documents containing the source code for software and hardware pertaining to Apple\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology. This defendant fled to China and is believed to be working for a PRC-based autonomous vehicle competitor.</p>\n<p>The fifth and final case involves a Chinese procurement network established to provide Iran with materials used in weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic missiles. In the Southern District of New York, a PRC national is charged with allegedly participating in a scheme to use his employer to conduct transactions with a U.S. financial institution for the benefit of a purported Iranian entity, as part of an effort to provide isostatic graphite, a material used in the production of WMDs, to Iran.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese charges demonstrate the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to preventing sensitive technology from falling into the hands of foreign adversaries, including Russia, China, and Iran,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWe will not tolerate those who would violate U.S. laws to allow authoritarian regimes and other hostile nations to use advanced technology to threaten U.S. national security and undermine democratic values around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProtecting sensitive American technology \u2013 like source code for \u2018smart\u2019 automotive manufacturing equipment or items used to develop quantum cryptography \u2013 from being illegally acquired by our adversaries is why we stood up the Disruptive Technology Strike Force,\u201d said Matthew S. Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the Department of Commerce. \u201cThe Strike Force actions announced today reflect the core mission of our Export Enforcement team \u2013 keeping our country\u2019s most sensitive technologies out of the world\u2019s most dangerous hands.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe theft of technology and trade secrets from U.S. companies is a threat to our economic and national security,\u201d said Assistant Director Suzanne Turner of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe charges announced today aren\u2019t the only instances of foreign adversaries trying to steal our technology. Combating the illegal transfer of technology is one of the FBI\u2019s highest priorities, and we will continue to work with our federal partners, including the Department of Commerce, to investigate those who steal U.S. technology to ultimately use it in weapons that threaten us and our allies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe protection of sensitive U.S. technologies has been and continues to be a top priority for HSI,\u201d said Assistant Director James Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations. \u201cHSI and the partners of the Strike Force will ensure that the U.S. maintains its technologic edge to protect the economic and national security interests of the United States. The Strike Force will be relentless in its pursuit of bad actors that attempt the theft of any sensitive U.S. technologies.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><u>United States v. Bogonikolos,\u00a0</u></em><u>Eastern District of New York</u></p>\n<p>A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Dr. Nikolaos \u201cNikos\u201d Bogonikolos, 59, of Athens, Greece, with wire fraud conspiracy and smuggling. Bogonikolos was arrested in Paris on May 9 and remains in custody pending the resolution of extradition proceedings.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, while ostensibly operating as a defense contractor for NATO and other ally countries, the defendant and his Aratos Group were double dealing, helping to fuel Russia\u2019s war effort and their development of next generation weapons,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cOur office continues to work tirelessly to ensure that disruptive technologies do not fall into the wrong hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint, the defendant headed the Aratos Group (Aratos), a collection of defense and technology companies in the Netherlands and Greece, which are both member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). According to Aratos\u2019s website, the companies\u2019 areas of expertise included space technologies, homeland security, blockchain, and counter-drone systems. One of Aratos\u2019 subsidiaries, Aratos Systems BV, was a finalist in the NATO Innovation Challenge for space applications in 2021 for a proposal involving the use of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology for satellites and spacecraft. The defendant presented himself having experience advising the European Parliament and \u201cgovernments worldwide,\u201d and Aratos supplied defense equipment and related technologies to countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. \u00a0</p>\n<p>However, as alleged in the complaint, since 2017 the defendant has been involved in smuggling U.S.-origin military and dual-use technologies to Russia in violation of U.S. law. These highly regulated and sensitive components included advanced electronics and sophisticated testing equipment used in military applications, including quantum cryptography and nuclear weapons testing, as well as tactical battlefield equipment. The defendant claimed that these items were to be used by Aratos, when in reality they were reshipped and sent to Russia in violation of U.S. law. Some of the Russian end users included nuclear and quantum research facilities, as well as Military Unit 33949, part of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, known as the SVR.</p>\n<p>As described in the complaint, many of these orders were solicited by Serniya Engineering and Sertal LLC (the Serniya Network), Moscow-based companies that operate under the direction of Russian intelligence services. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) levied sanctions against Serniya, Sertal, and several individuals and companies used in the scheme, calling them \u201cinstrumental to the Russian Federation\u2019s war machine.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint, the defendant was recruited as a procurement agent for Russia in 2017. In an email message with a Serniya affiliate, on Dec. 27, 2017, the defendant was told to come to Moscow alone \u201csince the agenda will be a very sensitive one.\u201d Regarding one subsequent order, the defendant advised that he would falsify an export license, saying \u201cI sign that the items are only for Netherlands ;) . . .

Besedin and Patsulya,\u00a0</u></em><u>District of Arizona</u></p>\n<p>On May 11, two Russian nationals, Oleg Sergeyevich Patsulya and Vasilii Sergeyevich Besedin were arrested in the District of Arizona and charged via criminal complaint with conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) and conspiracy to commit international money laundering.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that Patsulya and Besedin, both of whom reside in Miami-Dade County, Florida, used their Florida limited liability company, MIC P&amp;I, LLC, and worked with others to evade U.S. export laws and regulations to send aircraft parts to Russian airline companies. The complaint alleges that Patsulya and Besedin fielded requests for parts directly from the Russian airlines \u2014 many of which were already subject to increased export sanctions as a result of Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and then used intermediary companies and foreign bank accounts in third-party countries to mask the true identity of the customers and the source of payments. Patsulya and Besedin then approached aircraft parts suppliers in the United States, lied about who their customers were, and lied about where the parts would be going. In furtherance of their criminal conspiracy, Patsulya and Besedin traveled to the District of Arizona in September 2022 and attempted to purchase export-controlled aircraft brake systems from an Arizona aircraft parts supply company.</p>\n<p>If convicted, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison for violating the ECRA and up to 20 years in prison for conspiring to commit international money laundering.</p>\n<p>The BIS Phoenix Field Office and the FBI Phoenix Field Office are conducting the joint investigation.

Li,\u00a0</u></em><u>Central District of California</u></p>\n<p>A California man was arrested on May 6 in the Central District of California on criminal charges related to his alleged theft of sensitive technologies from his Southern California-based employers and use of them to market his own competing company to businesses in the PRC.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Liming Li, 64, of Rancho Cucamonga, stole trade secrets belonging to two of his former employers based in Southern California then used them to build his own competing business in China.</p>\n<p>Li was arrested at Ontario International Airport on May 6 after arriving on a flight from Taiwan pursuant to a criminal complaint that charges him with theft of trade secrets. Since his arrest, Li has been in federal custody, and he has a detention hearing scheduled for May 22.</p>\n<p>\u201cLi stole thousands of files of sensitive technology that did not belong to him and used it to help foreign companies build competing technology \u2013 technology that could be used in the manufacture of nuclear submarines and military aircraft,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central District of California. \u201cProtecting our nation\u2019s national security is paramount, and my office will aggressively investigate and prosecute those who misappropriate sensitive intellectual property to the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to an affidavit filed with the complaint, from 1996 to November 2019, Li worked in various engineering, management, and software development roles for two companies in Southern California software businesses. The companies are identified in court documents as \u201cCompany #1\u201d and \u201cCompany #2.\u201d</p>\n<p>These software programs are related to high precision measurement studies interpretation and point cloud technology, which often are used in making 3D models. They can be used in various sensitive manufacturing contexts, including manufacturing parts for nuclear submarines and military aircraft, and are subject to U.S. export controls for national security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism reasons. As a result of its military application, federal law mandates that this software cannot be exported to the PRC without a license from the Department of Commerce.</p>\n<p>Li worked for Company #1 from 1996 to 2018 and then worked at Company #2 from 2018 until November 2019. Shortly before beginning his employment with the Company #2, Li and his wife established their own business, JSL Innovations, which was based out of their Rancho Cucamonga home.</p>\n<p>After Company #2 terminated Li, company security discovered that Li was using his company-issued laptop to attempt to download files from Company #2\u2019s root directory onto his personal external hard drive, according to the complaint affidavit. Company security searched Li\u2019s company-issued laptop and found a folder labeled \u201cChinaGovernment.\u201d That folder allegedly contained numerous documents showing Li\u2019s efforts to participate in the PRC\u2019s Thousand Talents Program and to use JSL Innovations to provide services and technology to PRC business and government entities related to the export-controlled and trade secret technology that Li took from his former employers in Southern California.</p>\n<p>In March 2020, Li entered into an agreement with a PRC-based manufacturing company to serve as its chief technology officer. Li\u2019s agreement with this employer required him to spend at least six months per year in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Six months later, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Li\u2019s home and found numerous digital devices containing millions of files belonging to Company #1 and Company #2 and containing the source code for those companies\u2019 proprietary software, the complaint alleges. Although the source code files had been developed by and belonged to these companies, some of the files had been moved into folders labeled \u201cJSL\u201d or \u201cJSL Projects.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Company #1 and Company #2 derive significant value from the secrecy of their proprietary software source code and take extensive steps to protect the source code from discovery by competitors.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Li faces a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI is investigating this matter with substantial assistance from the Department of Commerce BIS.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Solomon Kim of the Terrorism and Export Crimes Section; David Ryan, Chief of the Terrorism and Export Crimes Section; Aaron Frumkin of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crime Section; and Trial Attorney Stephen Marzen of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em><u>United States v. Wang,\u00a0</u></em><u>Northern District of California</u></p>\n<p>Today, a federal court in the Northern District of California unsealed an indictment of former Apple Incorporated (Apple) employee Weibao Wang, 35, formerly of Mountain View, California, for charges related to his alleged theft and attempted theft of trade secrets in connection with a scheme to access, download, and steal Apple technology related to autonomous systems.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Apple hired Wang to work as a software engineer beginning in March 2016. The indictment describes how Wang signed a confidentiality agreement with Apple. The indictment further states that Apple provided Wang with in-person secrecy training that covered the appropriate handling of confidential material and established rules prohibiting the transfer and transmission of the company\u2019s intellectual property without Apple\u2019s consent. Wang was assigned to work with a team at Apple that designed and developed hardware and software for autonomous systems, which can have a variety of applications, such as self-driving cars.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, in November 2017, Wang signed a letter accepting an offer of full-time employment as a staff engineer with the U.S.-based subsidiary of a company headquartered in the PRC. The parent company is described in the indictment as \u201cCOMPANY ONE\u201d and allegedly was working to develop self-driving cars. The indictment alleges Wang waited more than four months after signing the new employment agreement before informing Apple that he was resigning.</p>\n<p>After Wang\u2019s last day at Apple on April 16, 2018, Apple representatives reviewed access logs documenting historical activity on Apple\u2019s network. Apple identified Wang as having accessed large amounts of sensitive proprietary and confidential information in the days leading up to his departure from Apple.</p>\n<p>The indictment describes the June 27, 2018, search by law enforcement of Wang\u2019s Mountain View residence and the discovery of large quantities of data taken from Apple prior to his departure. Wang was present during the search and told agents he had no plans to travel. Nevertheless, Wang purchased a one-way plane ticket from San Francisco International Airport to Guangzhou, China and boarded a flight that night.</p>\n<p>The indictment describes six categories of trade secrets that Wang allegedly stole, or attempted to steal, and charges him with one count for each category.</p>\n<p>Wang faces a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine in the amount of $250,000 (or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the scheme) for each count of theft or attempted theft of trade secrets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sloan Heffron and Marissa Harris for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case. Within the National Security Division, this matter is being handled by Brendan Geary of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p><em><u>United States v. Xiangjiang Qiao,\u00a0</u></em><u>Southern District of New York</u></p>\n<p>Today, a federal court in the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment charging Xiangjiang Qiao aka Joe Hansen, 39, of the People\u2019s Republic of China with sanctions evasion, money laundering, and bank fraud offenses based on Qiao\u2019s alleged participation in a scheme to use a sanctioned Chinese company to provide materials used in the production of WMDs to Iran, in exchange for payments made through the U.S. financial system. Qiao is at large in China.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Xiangjiang Qiao conspired to send isostatic graphite to Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions. Isostatic graphite is a high-tech material used in the nose tips of intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cThe Iranian regime of terror and repression, and those who facilitate it, pose a grave threat to our national security. This office will continue to work relentlessly to bring to justice those who advance the interests of the Iranian regime and thereby threaten the safety and security of the American people.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Qiao is a Chinese national and an employee of the China-based company Sinotech Dalian Carbon and Graphite Manufacturing Corporation (Sinotech Dalian). Sinotech Dalian is part of a network of Chinese companies involved in the proliferation of WMDs and that, in particular, provide assistance in the procurement of materials for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. In 2014, OFAC sanctioned Sinotech Dalian, adding the company to OFAC\u2019s SDN and Blocked Persons list, explaining that Sinotech Dalian is part of a network of China-based entities used to proliferate WMDs and, specifically, to aid Iranian ballistic missile procurement. Sinotech Dalian\u2019s inclusion on the SDN list prohibits it from using the U.S. financial system to conduct transactions without authorization from OFAC. Qiao is an associate of Li Fangwei, aka Karl Lee, who managed the Sinotech Dalian network of companies and was\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/li-fangwei-charged-manhattan-federal-court-using-web-front-companies-evade-us-sanctions?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">charged</a>\u00a0in 2014 with sanctions evasion and other offenses based on his alleged illicit activities as a principal contributor to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program through China-based entities.</p>\n<p>In willful violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and Sinotech Dalian, between at least March 2019 and September 2022, Qiao participated in a scheme to use Sinotech Dalian, including through transactions involving the U.S. financial system, to supply isostatic graphite to Iran for the production of WMDs. Isostatic graphite is a type of graphite with an ultra-fine grain that is used in the manufacture of WMDs. In particular, isostatic graphite is used in the manufacture of rocket nozzles and reentry vehicle nose tips in intercontinental ballistic missiles. Qiao further took steps to conceal Sinotech Dalian\u2019s involvement in the transaction by creating a bank account in the name of a front company to receive two transfers from a U.S. bank totaling over $15,000 as part of his efforts to facilitate the supply of isostatic graphite to Iran.</p>\n<p>Qiao is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran and Sinotech Dalian, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of violating the IEEPA, which each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; two counts of attempted bank fraud, which each carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and two counts of money laundering, which each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI New York Field Office and Counterintelligence Division are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Gillian S. Grossman and Nicholas S. Bradley for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Within the National Security Division, this matter is being handled by Trial Attorney S. Derek Shugert of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s actions were coordinated through the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation-states. Under the leadership of the Assistant Attorney General for National Security and the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, the Strike Force leverages tools and authorities across the U.S. Government to enhance the criminal and administrative enforcement of export control laws.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment, complaint or criminal information is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department today unsealed two indictments charging a Russian national and resident with using three different ransomware variants to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including law enforcement agencies in Washington, D.C. and New Jersey, as well as victims in healthcare and other sectors nationwide.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment obtained in the District of New Jersey, from at least as early as 2020, Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, aka Wazawaka, aka m1x, aka Boriselcin, aka Uhodiransomwar, allegedly participated in conspiracies to deploy three ransomware variants. These variants are known as LockBit, Babuk, and Hive, and Matveev transmitted ransom demands in connection with each. The perpetrators behind each of these variants, including Matveev, have allegedly used these types of ransomware to attack thousands of victims in the United States and around the world. These victims include law enforcement and other government agencies, hospitals, and schools. Total ransom demands allegedly made by the members of these three global ransomware campaigns to their victims amount to as much as $400 million, while total victim ransom payments amount to as much as $200 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom his home base in Russia, Matveev allegedly used multiple ransomware variants to attack critical infrastructure around the world, including hospitals, government agencies, and victims in other sectors,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThese international crimes demand a coordinated response. We will not relent in imposing consequences on the most egregious actors in the cybercrime ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n<p>On or about June 25, 2020, Matveev and his LockBit coconspirators allegedly deployed LockBit ransomware against a law enforcement agency in Passaic County, New Jersey. Additionally, on or about May 27, 2022, Matveev and his Hive coconspirators allegedly deployed Hive against a nonprofit behavioral healthcare organization headquartered in Mercer County, New Jersey. On April 26, 2021, Matveev and his Babuk coconspirators allegedly deployed Babuk against the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom Russia and hiding behind multiple aliases, Matveev is alleged to have used these ransomware strains to encrypt and hold hostage for ransom the data of numerous victims, including hospitals, schools, nonprofits, and law enforcement agencies, like the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThanks to the extraordinary investigative work of prosecutors from my office and our FBI partners, Matveev no longer hides in the shadows \u2013 we have publicly identified his criminal acts and charged him with multiple federal crimes. Let today\u2019s charges be a reminder to cybercriminals everywhere \u2013 my office is devoted to combatting cybercrime and will spare no resources in bringing to justice those who use ransomware attacks to target victims.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment obtained in the District of Columbia, between April 21, 2021, and May 9, 2021, Matveev allegedly participated in conspiracies to deploy Babuk and to transmit a ransom demand. Specifically, on April 26, 2021, Matveev and his Babuk co-conspirators allegedly deployed Babuk ransomware against the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., and then threatened to disclose sensitive information to the public unless a payment was made.</p>\n<p>\u201cData theft and extortion attempts by ransomware groups are corrosive, cynical attacks on key institutions and the good people behind them as they go about their business and serve the public,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cWhether these criminals target law enforcement, other government agencies, or private companies like health care providers, we will use every tool at our disposal to prosecute and punish such offenses. Thanks to exceptional work by our partners here, we identified and charged this culprit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is steadfast in our commitment to disrupting cybercriminals like Matveev,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThe FBI will continue to impose costs on cyber adversaries through our joint collaboration with our private sector and international partners, and we will not tolerate these criminal acts against American citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>The LockBit ransomware variant first appeared around January 2020. LockBit actors have executed over 1,400 attacks against victims in the United States and around the world, issuing over $100 million in ransom demands and receiving over $75 million in ransom payments.</p>\n<p>The Babuk ransomware variant first appeared around December 2020. Babuk actors executed over 65 attacks against victims in the United States and around the world, issuing over $49 million in ransom demands and receiving as much as $13 million in ransom payments.</p>\n<p>Since June 2021, the Hive ransomware group has targeted more than 1,400 victims around the world and received as much as $120 million in ransom payments.</p>\n<p>The LockBit, Babuk, and Hive ransomware variants operated in the same general manner: first, the ransomware actors would identify and unlawfully access vulnerable computer systems, sometimes through their own hacking, or by purchasing stolen access credentials from others. Second, the actors would deploy the ransomware variant within the victim computer system, allowing the actors to encrypt and steal data thereon. Next, the actors would send a ransom note to the victim demanding a payment in exchange for decrypting the victim\u2019s data or refraining from sharing it publicly. Finally, the ransomware actors would negotiate a ransom amount with each victim willing to pay. If a victim did not pay, ransomware actors would often post that victim\u2019s data on a public website, often called a data leak site. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Matveev is charged with conspiring to transmit ransom demands, conspiring to damage protected computers, and intentionally damaging protected computers. If convicted, he faces over 20 years in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI Newark Field Office\u2019s Cyber Crimes Task Force is investigating the case with valuable assistance from the Jersey City Police Department, New Jersey State Police, Newark IRS Criminal Investigation, and international partners from European Cyber Crime Centre of Europol, National Police Agency of Japan, Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command of France, National Crime Agency and South West Regional Organized Crime Unit of the United Kingdom, Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich of Switzerland, High-Tech Crime Unit of the Dutch Police Services Agency of the Netherlands, Bundeskriminalamt and Landeskriminalamt of Germany, Mossos d'Esquadra Police Department of Spain, Norwegian Police Service of Norway, and Swedish Police Authority of Sweden.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Jessica C. Peck, Benjamin Proctor, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS); Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly and David E. Malagold for the District of New Jersey\u2019s Cybercrime Unit in Newark; and Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Aloi for the District of Columbia\u2019s Fraud, Public Corruption, and Civil Rights Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The FBI Tampa Field Office and Orlando Resident Agency, along with Assistant U.S. Attorney Chauncey Bratt for the Middle District of Florida and CCIPS Trial Attorneys Christen Gallagher and Alison Zitron, made critical contributions to the case. The FBI Washington Field Office and Metropolitan Police Department also provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and National Security Division also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>Victims of LockBit, Babuk, or Hive ransomware should contact their local FBI field office for further information. For additional information on ransomware, including the LockBit, Babuk, and Hive variants, please visit StopRansomware.gov.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced that it is designating the defendant for his role in launching ransomware attacks against U.S. law enforcement, businesses, and critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Department of State has also announced an award of up to $10 million for information that leads to the arrest and/or conviction of this defendant. Information that may be eligible for this award can be submitted at tips.fbi.gov. Congress established the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program in 2013 to support law enforcement efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and bring their leaders and members to justice.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Today, the Department of Justice, and its Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team and international partners, announced the results of Operation SpecTor, which included 288 arrests \u2013 the most ever for any JCODE operation and nearly double that of the prior operation. Law enforcement also conducted more seizures than any prior operation, including 117 firearms, 850 kilograms of drugs that include 64 kilograms of fentanyl or fentanyl-laced narcotics, and $53.4 million in cash and virtual currencies.</p>\n<p>Operation SpecTor was a coordinated international effort spanning three continents to disrupt fentanyl and opioid trafficking on the darknet, or dark web. The operation was conducted across the United States, Europe, and South America, and was a result of the continued partnership between JCODE and foreign law enforcement against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services on the darknet. Operation SpecTor builds on the successes of prior years\u2019 operations and takedowns of marketplaces, which result in the seizure of darknet infrastructure providing investigators across the world with investigative leads and evidence. JCODE and Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) continue to compile intelligence packages to identify entities of interest. These leads allow U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to identify darknet drug vendors and buyers, resulting in a series of coordinated, but separate, law enforcement investigations, resulting in the statistics announced today.</p>\n<p>This year\u2019s law enforcement operation was accompanied by a public awareness campaign called Operation ProtecTor aimed to promote public safety and spread awareness of resources for those struggling with substance abuse and who go through extreme lengths to obtain opioids. JCODE has worked with every FBI field office in the country to facilitate outreach to households that have purchased individual amounts of opioids from the darknet. The interagency efforts are aimed to both identify those who use anonymizing technologies to purchase illicit narcotics and direct them to available resources.</p>\n<p>\u201cOperation SpecTor was a coordinated international law enforcement effort, spanning three continents, to disrupt drug trafficking on the dark web and represents the most funds seized and the highest number of arrests in any coordinated international action led by the Justice Department against drug traffickers on the dark web,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cOur message to criminals on the dark web is this: You can try to hide in the furthest reaches of the internet, but the Justice Department will find you and hold you accountable for your crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe availability of dangerous substances like fentanyl on dark net marketplaces is helping to fuel the crisis that has claimed far too many American lives,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThat's why we will continue to join forces with our law enforcement partners around the globe to attack this problem together. The FBI is proud to stand with our domestic and foreign partners as we continue to shine that light into the deepest corners of the dark net and hold those accountable who continue to peddle this poison around the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Sinaloa and Jalisco drug cartels, and the global networks they operate are killing Americans by sending fentanyl into the United States. Their associates distribute this fentanyl into communities across America by every means possible, including the dark web,\u201d said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. \u201cThe DEA is committed to shutting down the fentanyl supply chain from beginning to end, and we will relentlessly pursue the associates of these cartels wherever they hide, even in the dark corners of the internet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur coalition of law enforcement authorities across three continents proves that we all do better when we work together,\u201d said Executive Director Catherine De Bolle of Europol. \u201cThis operation sends a strong message to criminals on the dark web: international law enforcement has the means and the ability to identify and hold you accountable for your illegal activities, even on the dark web.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCollaboration with our law enforcement partners is key to combatting fentanyl and opioid trafficking,\u201d said Chief Jim Lee of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). \u201cUnder the JCODE umbrella, law enforcement agencies across the globe have joined forces to take down criminals who use the darknet to buy and sell narcotics. Our team at IRS-CI plays an integral role in these investigations by following the money trail, whether it\u2019s in fiat currency or digital assets on the blockchain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe illicit movement of opioids poses a significant threat to public health and safety \u2013 whether by known transnational criminal gang members across international borders or anonymously through darknet spaces,\u201d said Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Director P.J. Lechleitner of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). \u201cOur HSI special agents, alongside federal and international partners, continue to aggressively investigate, disrupt, and dismantle networks responsible for trafficking dangerous, deadly narcotics and other contraband across global communities we are charged with protecting. We will continue to pursue bad actors engaged in these crimes to ensure they face justice, while protecting victims from these lethal substances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service leverages our specialized knowledge of the postal system as part of sophisticated dark web investigations such as Operation SpecTor with great results,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. \u201cWe are committed to taking all necessary actions to combat illicit drugs in the mail. And we thank our law enforcement partners for working with us to achieve this; removing dangerous illicit substances from the mail and American communities saves lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAddressing our nation\u2019s drug overdose crisis and epidemic of substance use disorders is an issue of great concern and remains a top public health priority for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\u201d said Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D., of the FDA. \u201cThe FDA has undertaken strategic and impactful actions to prevent drug overdoses and reduce deaths and is committed to using all of our cyber-resources to shed light on the darkest corners of illicit medical supply chains for the health and safety of all Americans.\u201d</p>\n<p>Operation SpecTor resulted in over 100 federal operations and prosecutions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Dec. 1, 2022, Anton Peck, 29, of Boca Raton, Florida, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, including fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. According to court documents, between May 2021 and May 2022, Peck distributed narcotics from various darknet markets using the vendor profile \u201cSyntropy.\u201d After the transactions were carried out using cryptocurrency, Peck and co-conspirators Kevin Fusco and Vincent Banner mailed parcels containing fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine to cities around the country using the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Fusco, 35, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for conspiring to distribute fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine. Banner, 31, of Boynton Beach, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 8 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin. Law enforcement recovered kilogram quantities of fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin from business and storage locations in West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, and New York City. Peck possessed a list of more than 6,000 customers living across the United States. The DEA, FBI, USPS Office of Inspector General (USPS-OIG), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida is prosecuting the case.</li>\n<li>On Nov. 18, 2022, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Christopher Hampton, 36, of Cerritos, California, with heading an organization that obtained bulk fentanyl, operated labs in California that used high-speed pill presses to create fake pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine, and sold millions of pills to thousands of customers on the darknet. Hampton was named in an 11-count indictment that charges him with various narcotics and weapons offenses that could result in a sentence of life in prison. According to court documents, he was active on at least nine darknet marketplaces where he typically used the moniker \u201cNarco710.\u201d Hampton allegedly sold nearly $2 million worth of narcotics on two of these darknet marketplaces alone. He was arrested on Nov. 2, 2022, at which time federal law enforcement executed search warrants that led to the discovery and seizure of 450 pounds of suspected narcotics; six pill press machines, some of which were capable of producing thousands of pills per hour; and illegal firearms that included assault rifles and a machine gun. Agents later located a storage unit linked to the drug conspiracy and seized over 80 pounds of pressed fentanyl pills, eight guns, and precursor materials to press additional pills. The FBI JCODE and DEA HIDTA Tactical Diversion Squad investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California is prosecuting the case.</li>\n<li>On May 12, 2022, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Holly Adams, 31, and Devlin Hosner, 33, of Indio, California, with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl and methamphetamine, and with conspiracy to launder money. According to court documents, Adams and Hosner operated the vendor accounts \u201cigogrrawwr\u201d and \u201cits4real\u201d on the darknet marketplaces ToRReZ and Darkode, respectively, through which they sold tens of thousands of counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl in exchange for cryptocurrency. Adams and Hosner shipped these fentanyl pills to buyers throughout the United States, using the USPS, UPS, and other means of delivery. In the course of their conspiracy, Adams and Hosner finalized over 1,100 transactions of narcotics and other contraband and received more than $800,000 in cryptocurrency. Federal law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at a hotel in Riverside county where Adams and Hosner were residing and recovered more than 10,000 counterfeit oxycodone pills as well as approximately 60 grams of methamphetamine. The IRS-CI, HSI, FBI, USPIS, and USPS-OIG investigated the case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California is prosecuting the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operation SpecTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice, FBI, DEA, USPIS, HSI, IRS-CI, ATF, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and the FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations. This operation was aided by non-operational supporting participation from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Local, state, and other federal agencies also contributed to Operation SpecTor investigations through task force participation and regional partnerships. The investigations leading to Operation SpecTor were significantly aided by support and coordination by the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF); multi-agency Special Operations Division; the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and Fraud Section; the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs; Europol and its Dark Web team; and international partners. The international partners include Eurojust; Austria\u2019s Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt); France\u2019s Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes (Douane); Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Central Criminal Investigation Department of Oldenburg (Zentrale KriminaIinspektion Oldenburg), General Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Frankfurt/Main - Cybercrime Center (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt/Main, Zentralstelle zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Internetkriminalit\u00e4t), Berlin Police (Polizei Berlin), various police departments (Dienststellen der L\u00e4nderpolizeien), German Customs Investigation (Zollfahndungs\u00e4mter); the Netherland\u2019s National Police (Politie); Poland\u2019s Central Cybercrime Bureau (Centralne Biuro Zwalczania Cyberprzest\u0119pczo\u015bci); Brazil\u2019s Civil Police of the State of Piau\u00ed (Pol\u00edcia Civil do Estado do Piau\u00ed), Civil Police of the Federal District (Pol\u00edcia Civil do Distrito Federal), National Secretariat of Public Security - Directorate of Integrated Operations and Intelligence - Cyber Operations Laboratory (Laborat\u00f3rio de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Cibern\u00e9ticas da Diretoria de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Integradas e de Intelig\u00eancia - Secretaria Nacional de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica); Switzerland\u2019s Zurich Cantonal Police (Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich) and Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office II of the Canton of Zurich (Staatsanwaltschaft II); and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) and National Police Chief\u2019s Council (NPCC).</p>\n<p>Federal investigations and prosecutions are being conducted in more than 30 federal districts, including the District of Arizona, the Central District of California, the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, the Southern District of California, the District of Colorado, the District of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, the District of Delaware, the Southern District of Florida, the Northern District of Georgia, the Southern District of Indiana, the Eastern District of Kentucky, the District of Maryland, the District of Massachusetts, the Eastern District of Michigan, the Western District of Michigan, the Eastern District of Missouri, the Western District of Missouri, the District of Nebraska, the District of Nevada, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District of New York, the Southern District of New York, the Western District of North Carolina, the Northern District of Ohio, the Southern District of Ohio, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the District of South Dakota, the Eastern District of Tennessee, the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of Texas, the Southern District of Texas, the District of Vermont, the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Western District of Washington.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department established the FBI-led JCODE team to lead and coordinate government efforts to detect, disrupt, and dismantle major criminal enterprises reliant on the darknet for trafficking opioids and other illicit narcotics, along with identifying and dismantling their supply chains.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Michel received Low\u2019s money and contributed it both personally and through approximately 20 straw donors. Michel also caused a presidential joint fundraising committee and an independent expenditure committee to submit false reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). In addition, Michel personally submitted a false declaration to the FEC, conspired to commit money laundering and make false statements to financial institutions related to the foreign influence campaigns, and attempted to cause witnesses to make false statements to and withhold information from law enforcement officials about the scheme.</p>\n<p>\u201cMichel played a central role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to improperly influence top government officials, including the then-President of the United States and the then-Attorney General,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Harry A.

Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWe will continue to work to disrupt and deter North Korean actors and those who aid them by following the money on the blockchain and shining a light on their conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Sim Hyon Sop (Sim), 39, is charged with allegedly conspiring with over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency traders to use stolen funds to buy goods for North Korea and for conspiring with North Korean IT workers to generate revenue through illegal employment at blockchain development companies in the United States.</p>\n<p>The first indictment involves a conspiracy between Sim and three OTC traders to launder stolen funds from virtual currency exchange hacks to make payments in U.S. dollars for goods on behalf of the North Korean government. The second involves a conspiracy between Sim and various North Korean IT workers to launder proceeds of illegal IT development work, where the IT workers gained employment at U.S. blockchain development companies using fake identities, and then laundered their ill-gotten gains through Sim for the benefit of the North Korean regime, and in contravention of sanctions imposed against North Korea by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the United Nations. Those sanctions were imposed to impede the development of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles, weapons production, and research and development programs.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictments reveal North Korea\u2019s continued use of various means to circumvent U.S. sanctions,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cWe can and will \u2018follow the money,\u2019 be it through cryptocurrency or the traditional banking system, to bring appropriate charges against those who would help to fund this corrupt regime.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to court documents, North Korean national Sim, Chinese national Wu Huihu (Wu), Hong Kong British National (Overseas) Cheng Hung Man (Cheng), and the user of the online moniker live:jammychen0150 (\u201cJammy Chen\u201d) conspired to launder stolen cryptocurrency and then used those funds to purchase goods through Hong Kong-based front companies on behalf of North Korea. Sim directed these payments, which were made in U.S. dollars, through \u201cJammy Chen.\u201d \u201cJammy Chen\u201d then recruited Wu and Cheng, both of whom were OTC traders, to find sham front companies and facilitate the payments to avoid U.S. sanctions against North Korea.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs criminals engage in new methods of exploiting and laundering cryptocurrency, the FBI will continue to relentlessly pursue them and bring them to justice,\u201d said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThese individuals used their illicit criminal activity to aid the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Today\u2019s indictment demonstrates the power of strong investigative work and collaboration amongst partners in holding state operatives accountable.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sim also allegedly conspired to launder funds generated by North Korean IT workers who obtained illegal employment in the tech and crypto industry. These IT workers used fake personas to get jobs, including jobs at U.S.-based companies, and then asked to be paid in cryptocurrencies, such as stablecoins like USD Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which are pegged to the U.S. dollar. After receiving payment, they funneled their earnings back to North Korea through Sim.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) is North Korea\u2019s primary intelligence and clandestine operations unit, known to have a cyber capability that has come to be known within the cybersecurity community as both Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). APT38 is a financially motivated North Korean regime-backed group responsible for conducting destructive cyber-attacks since at least 2014 to generate revenue for its ballistic missile and WMD programs. Specifically, these North Korean hackers have worked in concert to conduct cyber-attacks against victims located in the United States and around the world, including hacks against financial institutions and virtual asset service providers. North Korean actors have gained unauthorized access to these victim networks as part of their fraudulent scheme through a variety of means, including through spear-phishing messages designed to induce victims to download and execute malicious software developed by the hackers. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Since 2017, as part of its cyber campaign, North Korean hackers have also executed virtual currency-related thefts to generate revenue for the regime, including through the hacking of virtual asset services providers, such as virtual currency exchanges. A portion of the proceeds from those virtual currency theft and fraud schemes was sent to virtual currency address 1G3Qj4Y4trA8S64zHFsaD5GtiSwX19qwFv, which Sim and his OTC trader coconspirators used to fund payments for goods for North Korea.</p>\n<p>To generate revenue for the regime, North Korea also deploys IT workers to obtain illegal employment in the cryptocurrency industry. According to court documents, North Koreans apply for jobs in remote IT development work without disclosing that they are North Korean. These IT workers bypass security and due diligence checks through the false or fraudulent use of identity documents and other obfuscation strategies, such as virtual private networks to hide their true location from online payment facilitators and hiring platforms. The IT workers request payment for their services in virtual currency and then send their earnings back to North Korea via, among other methods, FTB representatives such as Sim.</p>\n<p>A third indictment also unsealed today in the District of Columbia separately charges Wu with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. According to court documents, Wu operated as an OTC trader on a U.S.-based virtual currency exchange and conducted over 1,500 trades for U.S. customers without obtaining the necessary licenses.</p>\n<p>The FBI Chicago Field Office and FBI\u2019s Virtual Assets Unit (VAU) are investigating the cases.</p>\n<p>The charge of conspiring to launder monetary instruments is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison. The charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business is punishable by a maximum of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Jessica Peck of the Justice Department\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Steven Wasserman and Christopher Tortorice for the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney Emma Ellenrieder of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the cases. Paralegal Specialists Brian Rickers and Angela De Falco and Legal Assistant Jessica McCormick provided valuable assistance. Significant assistance was also provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, FBI Los Angeles Field Office, Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, former Special Agent Chris Janczewski of the IRS Criminal Investigation, and former FBI analyst Nick Carlsen.</p>\n<p>The NCET was created in October 2021 to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Under the supervision of the Criminal Division, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that enable the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also sets strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identifies areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and leads the department\u2019s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department today announced charges unsealed in the Southern District of New York, Northern District of Illinois, and District of Columbia, against several leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, a transnational drug trafficking organization based in Sinaloa, Mexico, and its facilitators across the globe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, the Justice Department is announcing significant enforcement actions against the largest, most violent, and most prolific fentanyl trafficking operation in the world \u2013 run by the Sinaloa Cartel, and fueled by Chinese precursor chemical and pharmaceutical companies,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cFamilies and communities across our country are being devastated by the fentanyl epidemic. Today\u2019s actions demonstrate the comprehensive approach the Justice Department is taking to disrupt fentanyl trafficking and save American lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fentanyl crisis in America \u2013 fueled in large part by the Sinaloa cartel \u2013 threatens our public health, our public safety, and our national security,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cToday\u2019s indictments target every element of the Sinaloa Cartel's trafficking network and reflect the Justice Department's commitment to attacking every aspect of this threat: from the chemical companies in China that spawn fentanyl precursors, to the illicit labs that produce the poison, to the networks and money launderers and murderers that facilitate its distribution. Just as we have gone on offense against terrorists and cyber criminals around the globe, the Department is now waging a relentless campaign to disrupt the production and trafficking of fentanyl \u2013 before it can reach its victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictments send a clear message to the Chapitos, the Sinaloa Cartel, and criminal drug networks around the world that the DEA will stop at nothing to protect the national security of the United States and the safety and health of the American people,\u201d said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. \u201cThe Chapitos pioneered the manufacture and trafficking of fentanyl \u2013 the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced \u2013 flooded it into the United States for the past eight years and killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Over the last year and a half, the DEA proactively infiltrated the Sinaloa Cartel and the Chapitos network, obtained unprecedented access to the organization\u2019s highest levels, and followed them across the world. I am grateful to the men and women of the DEA for their exceptional work on this case, which is the beginning of our work as \u2018One DEA\u2019 to dismantle every part of the criminal cartels that are killing Americans at record rates.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFar too many Americans have become victims in the national fentanyl crisis. These cartels have shown us they will stop at nothing to manufacture, traffic, and push these dangerous drugs to every corner of our country,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cToday\u2019s indictments show that the FBI and our law enforcement partners will never tire in our pursuit not only to shut down their criminal enterprises, but also to go after individuals in their network. I want to thank the FBI team continuing to work on these cases everyday as we join with our law enforcement partners to tackle this national epidemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment is another example of how this administration is taking on the cartels and their transnational criminal networks, and sending a clear message that we are going to hold them accountable,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cI commend our workforce at Homeland Security Investigations and our federal partners who are relentless in their efforts to stop the scourge of fentanyl. Today\u2019s announcement exemplifies a whole-of-government approach to protecting our homeland that is yielding results.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sinaloa Cartel is one of the most powerful drug cartels in the world and is largely responsible for the manufacturing and importing of fentanyl for distribution in the United States. Fentanyl is a dangerous synthetic opioid that is more than 50 times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49, and it has fueled the opioid epidemic that has been ravaging families and communities across the United States for approximately the past eight years. Between 2019 and 2021, fatal overdoses increased by approximately 94%, with an estimated 196 Americans dying each day from fentanyl.</p>\n<p>The Sinaloa Cartel operated as an affiliation of drug traffickers and money launderers who obtain precursor chemicals \u2013 largely from China \u2013 for the manufacture of synthetic drugs, manufacture drugs in Mexico, move those drugs into the United States, and collect, launder, and transfer the proceeds of drug trafficking. Once led by Joaquin Guzman Loera, aka El Chapo, and Ismael Zambada Garcia, aka El Mayo, the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s members and associates \u2013 allegedly including the sons of Guzman Loera, collectively known as the Chapitos \u2013 smuggled significant quantities of drugs through Mexico and into the United States. The Chapitos are Ivan Guzman Salazar, 40, Alfredo Guzman Salazar, 37, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, 36, and Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 33.</p>\n<p>Following Guzman Loera\u2019s arrest in January 2016 and extradition to the United States in January 2017, the Chapitos allegedly assumed their father\u2019s former role as leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, along with Zambada Garcia and Damaso Lopez Nunez, aka Licenciado. The Chapitos subsequently amassed greater control over the Sinaloa Cartel by allegedly threatening and causing violence against Lopez Nunez, his family, and his associates and, as a result, became principal leaders and drug traffickers within the Sinaloa Cartel.</p>\n<p>The indictments being unsealed today demonstrate that the Sinaloa Cartel has been engaged in drug trafficking activities into the United States, and violence, spanning over a decade and a half.\u00a0 The Chapitos are alleged to have repeatedly and consistently transported lethal amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Chapitos allegedly used cargo aircraft, private aircraft, submarines and other submersible and semi-submersible vessels, container ships, supply vessels, go-fast boats, fishing vessels, buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, automobiles, and private and commercial interstate and foreign carriers to transport their drugs and precursor chemicals.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A California woman was sentenced on April 7 to four years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by providing services, including financial services, to Iran and the Government of Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran, and for structuring.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Niloufar Bahadorifar, aka Nellie Bahadorifar, 48, of Irvine, pleaded guilty on Dec. 15, 2022, before U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, who imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Government of Iran has shown that it will take extreme measures to silence dissidents and critics around the world exercising their lawful rights, including through the use of violence on U.S. soil,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWe hold accountable an individual who violated U.S. sanctions by providing financial assistance that ultimately supported a failed kidnapping plot directed by the Iranian government, underscoring the Department\u2019s commitment to bringing to justice those who criminally aid the Iranian regime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNiloufar Bahadorifar provided financial support to a brazen plot intended to kidnap an Iranian human rights activist living in the United States whom the Iranian Government has sought to silence for years,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cEfforts by malign foreign governments to stifle free speech and peaceful protest by means of intimidation or repression cannot be tolerated. The right to free speech is a core fundamental principle of American ideals, and this office is proud to protect that right with every means at our disposal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSimply put, the defendant provided assistance to individuals who tried to help kidnap a journalist living in New York, who has criticized the regime in Teheran,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr.\u00a0of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThis case demonstrates that the government of Iran will continue to target dissidents and reach beyond their borders, violating U.S sanctions and national security, but more importantly threaten the personal safety of individuals living in our country.\u00a0The FBI will continue to shield those who are targeted and aggressively pursue anyone who attempts to circumvent our laws and will leverage all our authorities to protect the right to free speech.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment and other documents in the public record, as well as statements made in public court proceedings:</p>\n<p>For years, the Government of Iran has targeted a prominent Iranian dissident living in New York City (the Victim). The Victim is a journalist, author and human rights activist who has publicized the Government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses and suppression of political expression. Beginning in at least 2020, Iranian intelligence officials and assets, including co-defendant Mahmoud Khazein, plotted to kidnap the Victim from within the United States for rendition to Iran in an effort to silence the Victim\u2019s criticism of the regime. As part of that plot, on multiple occasions in 2020 and 2021, agents of the Government of Iran procured the services of private investigators to surveil, photograph, and video record the Victim and the Victim\u2019s household members. These agents of the Government of Iran, including Khazein, procured the surveillance by misrepresenting their identities and the purpose of the surveillance to the investigators and laundered money into the United States from Iran in order to pay for the surveillance, photos and video recordings of the Victim.</p>\n<p>Beginning in approximately 2015, Bahadorifar, a U.S. citizen residing in California and originally from Iran, provided financial and other services, including access to the U.S. financial system and U.S. financial institutions, to Iranian residents and entities, including to Khazein. Bahadorifar, who is not charged with participating in the kidnapping conspiracy, provided financial services that ultimately supported the plot. Among other things, Bahadorifar caused a payment to be made to a private investigator for surveillance of the Victim on behalf of Khazein. Bahadorifar\u2019s payment obscured the origin of those who had hired the private investigator, who surveilled the Victim without knowing it was on behalf of Iranian intelligence services. At no time did Bahadorifar obtain permission from OFAC to provide services to Iran.</p>\n<p>Beginning in approximately 2019, Bahadorifar also structured cash deposits totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. In total, Bahadorifar structured at least approximately $476,100 in more than 120 individual deposits. All but two of the deposits were less than $10,000.</p>\n<p>The FBI New York Field Office Counterintelligence-Cyber Division and the New York FBI Iran Threat Task Force investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the NYPD Intelligence Bureau, the FBI Los Angeles Field Office and the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael D. Lockard, Jacob H. Gutwillig and Matthew J.C. Hellman for the Southern District of New York and Trial Attorney Christopher M. Rigali of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p></div>",

Amirov, who resides in Iran, arrived in the Southern District of New York on Jan. 26, and will be arraigned on charges before Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave today. Mehdiyev was arrested on July 29, 2022, on charges contained in an underlying criminal complaint and will be arraigned on the charges in the superseding indictment before the Honorable Colleen McMahon on Jan. 31, 2023, at 4 p.m. ET. Omarov was arrested in the Czech Republic on Jan. 4, 2023, and the United States will request his extradition on the charges in the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Victim in this case was targeted for exercising the rights to which every American citizen is entitled.\u00a0The Victim publicized the Iranian Government's human rights abuses; discriminatory treatment of women; suppression of democratic participation and expression; and use of arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and execution,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Department of Justice will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to undermine those protections and the rule of law upon which our democracy is based. \u00a0We will not tolerate attempts by a foreign power to threaten, silence, or harm Americans.\u00a0We will stop at nothing to identify, find, and bring to justice those who endanger the safety of the American people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment exposes a dangerous menace to national security \u2013 a double threat posed by a vicious transnational crime group operating from what it thought was the safe haven of a rogue nation: Iran,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cAs national security and criminal threats continue to blend, the Department of Justice will use all its tools to zealously protect freedom and hold accountable all those who would use violence to undermine it.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment unsealed today reflects the FBI\u2019s commitment to follow the facts wherever they lead, to work our way up to the leaders of criminal plots wherever they are, and to use our long reach to bring those responsible here to face justice in the United States,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe conduct charged shows how far Iranian actors are willing to go to silence critics, even attempting to assassinate a U.S. citizen on American soil. We are determined to safeguard the rights of all Americans from the oppressive reach of hostile regimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s charges underscore the Department\u2019s commitment to protecting Americans and our fundamental values in the face of all forms of transnational repression,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cTo foreign actors who plot violence on our soil believing they are out of our reach, know that we will pursue you, wherever you may be, until we deliver justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, the defendants are members of an organized crime group hired to assassinate, right here in New York City, a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin who has been critical of the regime\u2019s autocracy and its disregard for human rights,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cThis is the second time in the past two years that this office and our partners at the FBI have disrupted plots originating from within Iran to kidnap or kill this victim for the \u2018crime\u2019 of exercising the right to free speech, to independent political thought, and to advocating for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised inside Iran.\u00a0Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the career prosecutors and FBI agents who led the investigation, this new plot to silence the victim has been disrupted and the defendants will face justice in an American court.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the superseding indictment, other court filings, and statements made during court proceedings:</p>\n<p>Amirov is a leader in an Eastern European criminal organization (the Organization) who resides in Iran. Omarov also holds a leadership role in the Organization and resides in Eastern Europe. Mehdiyev, a member of the Organization, resides in Yonkers, New York. The Organization has ties to Iran and is violent, engaging in murders, kidnappings, assaults, and extortions, and members typically identify themselves with tattoos and other displays of eight-pointed stars.</p>\n<p>Since at least July 2022, the Organization was tasked with carrying out the murder of a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin (the Victim), who previously has been the target of plots by the Government of Iran to intimidate, harass and kidnap the Victim. The Victim is a journalist, author and human rights activist, residing in Brooklyn, New York, who has publicized the Government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses and suppression of political expression, including in connection with continuing protests against the regime across Iran. As recently as 2020 and 2021, Iranian intelligence officials and assets plotted to kidnap the Victim from within the United States for rendition to Iran in an effort to silence the Victim\u2019s criticism of the regime. That plot was disrupted and exposed by the FBI and led to the filing of federal kidnapping conspiracy and other charges in the Southern District of New York against several participants in the plot in <i>United States v. Farahani, et al.</i>, 21 Cr. 430.</p>\n<p>About one year after the <i>Farahani</i> charges were filed, the Organization was tasked with carrying out the Victim\u2019s assassination on U.S. soil. Beginning in approximately mid-July 2022, Amirov sent targeting information \u2013 which Amirov had received from other individuals in Iran \u2013 about the Victim and the Victim\u2019s residence to Omarov. Omarov, in turn, communicated the targeting information to Mehdiyev in order to begin conducting surveillance of the Victim and reconnaissance of the Victim\u2019s residence and surrounding neighborhood. Mehdiyev sent photographs and videos of the Victim\u2019s residence to Omarov for further sharing with Amirov and the plot\u2019s orchestrators in Iran.</p>\n<p>After Mehdiyev\u2019s initial surveillance of the Victim\u2019s residence, Amirov and Omarov arranged for the delivery of a $30,000 cash payment to Mehdiyev in New York City in furtherance of the plot. Mehdiyev used a portion of this cash payment to buy an AK-47-style assault rifle along with two magazines for ammunition and at least 66 rounds. Mehdiyev bragged in electronic communications that he had procured for himself a \u201cwar machine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Between July 20 and 28, 2022, Mehdiyev repeatedly traveled to the Victim\u2019s neighborhood to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance, sending reports of the Victim\u2019s activities, photographs, and videos to Omarov for further distribution to Amirov. On July 24, 2022, after arriving at the Victim\u2019s residence, Mehdiyev reported to Omarov that Mehdiyev was \u201cat the crime scene.\u201d Omarov encouraged Mehdiyev, \u201cYou are a man!\u201d\u00a0 Mehdiyev described to Omarov that \u201cwe blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house.\u201d Omarov forwarded this report to Amirov, who responded, \u201cGod willing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mehdiyev was unable to carry out the assassination that day and returned on several subsequent days to seek out opportunities to complete the murder mission. Amirov, Omarov and Mehdiyev schemed different strategies to attempt to draw the Victim out, including by attempting to ask the Victim for flowers from the Victim\u2019s garden. On July 28, 2022, Mehdiyev sent Omarov a video taken from inside the car Mehdiyev was driving showing the assault rifle, along with the message that \u201cwe are ready.\u201d The Victim, after observing suspicious activity outside the residence, left the area, and Mehdiyev drove away shortly afterwards. After Mehdiyev drove away from the Victim\u2019s residence, he was stopped after a traffic violation, and during a subsequent search of the car, police officers found the assault rifle, 66 rounds of ammunition, approximately $1,100 in cash, and a black ski mask.</p>\n<p>Amirov, Omarov, and Mehdiyev are charged with: (1) murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; (2)\u00a0conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; and (3) conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Mehdiyev is additionally charged with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI and its New York Field Office Counterintelligence-Cyber Division, the New York FBI Iran Threat Task Force, the New York FBI Counterintelligence Task Force and the New York FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating the case, with valuable assistance provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the NYPD Intelligence Bureau, as well as the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael D.

Lum Davis and others also agreed to lobby the Administration and Justice Department on behalf of Low and a minister of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC Minister A), to arrange for the removal and return of a dissident of the PRC living in the United States. Lum Davis and her co-conspirators concealed from the officials whom they lobbied that they were working on behalf of Low and PRC Minister A, and were being paid millions of dollars by Low with the expectation of tens of millions more in success fees. The lobbying campaigns were ultimately unsuccessful.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among other actions, Lum Davis and her co-conspirators tried to arrange meetings for PRC Minister A with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other high-level officials during PRC Minister A\u2019s visit to the United States in May 2017; provided talking points to the Secretary of State referencing the 1MDB investigation in advance of a meeting between the Secretary of State and the Malaysian Prime Minister in August 2017; and pushed the White House Chief of Staff for a meeting and golf game between the former President and the Malaysian Prime Minister to allow the Malaysian Prime Minister to raise resolution of the 1MDB investigation. Lum Davis was paid at least $3 million for her role in the scheme, which she agreed to forfeit as part of her plea agreement. Broidy was paid at least $9 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Broidy previously pleaded guilty for his role in the scheme on Oct. 20, 2020, in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Broidy received a full presidential pardon on Jan. 19, 2021.</p>\n<p>Higginbotham previously pleaded guilty for his role in the scheme on Nov. 30, 2018, in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He will be sentenced at a later date.</p>\n<p>Michel was charged by superseding indictment for his role in the scheme on June 10, 2021. His trial is set to begin on March 27 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Two Estonian citizens were arrested in Tallinn, Estonia, yesterday on an 18-count indictment for their alleged involvement in a $575 million cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n<p>The indictment was returned by a grand jury in the Western District of Washington on Oct. 27 and unsealed today.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Tur\u00f5gin, both 37, allegedly defrauded hundreds of thousands of victims through a multi-faceted scheme. They induced victims to enter into fraudulent equipment rental contracts with the defendants\u2019 cryptocurrency mining service called HashFlare. They also caused victims to invest in a virtual currency bank called Polybius Bank. In reality, Polybius was never actually a bank, and never paid out the promised dividends. Victims paid more than $575 million to Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin\u2019s companies. Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin then used shell companies to launder the fraud proceeds and to purchase real estate and luxury cars.</p>\n<p>\u201cNew technology has made it easier for bad actors to take advantage of innocent victims \u2013 both in the U.S. and abroad \u2013 in increasingly complex scams,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe department is committed to preventing the public from losing more of their hard-earned money to these scams and will not allow these defendants, or others like them, to keep the fruits of their crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe size and scope of the alleged scheme is truly astounding. These defendants capitalized on both the allure of cryptocurrency, and the mystery surrounding cryptocurrency mining, to commit an enormous Ponzi scheme,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown for the Western District of Washington. \u201cThey lured investors with false representations and then paid early investors off with money from those who invested later. They tried to hide their ill-gotten gain in Estonian properties, luxury cars, and bank accounts and virtual currency wallets around the world. U.S. and Estonian authorities are working to seize and restrain these assets and take the profit out of these crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"The FBI is committed to pursuing subjects across international boundaries who are utilizing increasingly complex schemes to defraud investors,\u201d said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cVictims in the U.S. and abroad invested into what they believed were sophisticated virtual asset ventures, but it was all part of a fraudulent scheme and thousands of victims were harmed as a result. The FBI thanks our national and international partners for their efforts throughout the investigation to help bring justice for the victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin claimed that HashFlare was a massive cryptocurrency mining operation. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of using computers to generate cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for profit. Potapenk and Tur\u00f5gin offered contracts which, for a fee, purported to allow customers to rent a percentage of HashFlare\u2019s mining operations in exchange for the virtual currency produced by their portion of the operation. HashFlare\u2019s website enabled customers to see the amount of virtual currency their mining activity had supposedly generated. Customers from around the world, including western Washington, entered into more than $550 million worth of HashFlare contracts between 2015 and 2019.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, these contracts were fraudulent. HashFlare allegedly did not have the virtual currency mining equipment it claimed to have. HashFlare\u2019s equipment allegedly performed Bitcoin mining at a rate of less than one percent of the computing power it purported to have. When investors asked to withdraw their mining proceeds, Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin were not able to pay the mined currency as promised. Instead, they either resisted making the payments, or paid off the investors using virtual currency the defendants had purchased on the open market\u2014not currency they had mined. HashFlare closed its operations in 2019.</p>\n<p>In May 2017, Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin offered investments in a company called Polybius, which they promised would form a bank specializing in virtual currency. They promised to pay investors dividends from Polybius\u2019s profits. The men raised at least $25 million in this scheme and transferred most of the money to other bank accounts and virtual currency wallets they controlled. Polybius never formed a bank or paid any dividends.</p>\n<p>The indictment also charges Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin with conspiring to launder their criminal proceeds by using shell companies and phony contracts and invoices. The money laundering conspiracy allegedly involved at least 75 real properties, six luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency wallets, and thousands of cryptocurrency mining machines.</p>\n<p>Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin are both charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, Potapenko and Tur\u00f5gin each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>The United States thanks the Cybercrime Bureau of the National Criminal Police of the Estonian Police and Border Guard for its support with this investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided extensive assistance to the investigation.</p>\n<p>This investigation and today\u2019s arrest demonstrate the great coordination and cooperation between U.S. and Estonian law enforcement. Estonia has been a crucial ally to disrupt this cyber-enabled crime, and the United States thanks the Estonians for their continued assistance and coordination.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys Adrienne E. Rosen and Olivia Zhu of the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Jehiel I. Baer for the Western District of Washington are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>Individuals who believe they may have been a victim in this case should visit <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/hashflare\">www.fbi.gov/hashflare</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Some of the department\u2019s most notable successes against drug cartels have resulted from OCDETF coordinated investigations and prosecutions. OCDETF was instrumental in taking down the powerful Colombian cartels of the 1980s; the notorious and violent Mexican cartels such as the Tijuana, Juarez and Gulf Cartels in the 1990s; and the methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl and opioid threats from all over the world in the last two decades.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As criminal networks have grown more sophisticated in the last 40 years \u2014 branching out to more varied types of criminal activity \u2014 OCDETF has responded by expanding its mission beyond drug trafficking organizations and money laundering networks to all forms of transnational organized crime. OCDETF is fully engaged in all manner of investigations into criminal networks involved in human smuggling, sophisticated financial fraud, cyber-enabled crime, illicit finance, arms trafficking, government benefits theft, business e-mail compromise and U.S. sanctions evasion. OCDETF is uniquely and ideally structured to support the fight against transnational organized crime through operational integration, collaboration and law enforcement information sharing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince its founding, OCDETF has been a synchronizer and our role is to incentivize prosecutors to lead smart, creative law enforcement agents in investigations focused on priority targets of organized criminal groups and the illicit financial networks that support them,\u201d said OCDETF Director Adam W. Cohen. \u201cToday, OCDETF provides a forward leaning structure for our partners to work together and leverage each other\u2019s strengths, capabilities and legal authorities resulting in continued positive impacts to the nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>OCDETF\u2019s successes over the last 40 years have been made possible by strong collaboration and coordination with its member agencies. OCDETF is partnered with the 93 U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the department\u2019s Criminal Division and 11 federal law enforcement agencies from the Department of Justice (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Federal Bureau of Investigation; U.S. Marshals Service), Homeland Security (Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Homeland Security Investigations; U.S. Coast Guard; U.S. Secret Service), Treasury (Internal Revenue Service/Criminal Investigation), Postal (U.S. Postal Inspection Service), Labor (Office of the Inspector General), and State (Bureau of Diplomatic Security).</p>\n<p>OCDETF\u2019s governance, bringing leadership to the multi-agency transnational organized crime mission and focus on joint priority targets has generated genuine measurable accomplishments \u2014 over 34,000 multi-agency cases against priority targets, over 124,000 indictments of almost 360,000 defendants, and incredibly, over 15,690 of those resulted in impactful disruption, or even dismantlement of criminal organizations. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs OCDETF begins our 41<sup>st</sup> year, we will continue to provide a coordination platform for comprehensive investigations and prosecutions of the most dangerous transnational criminal organizations, the successful result of which is to make our nation safer,\u201d said OCDETF Director Cohen.</p></div>",

Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThis indictment makes clear that even other Iranians are less safe because their own government fails to follow international norms and stop Iranian cyber criminals.\u201d</p>\n<p>The defendants\u2019 hacking campaign exploited known vulnerabilities in commonly used network devices and software applications to gain access and exfiltrate data and information from victims\u2019 computer systems. Ahmadi, Khatibi, Nickaein and others also conducted encryption attacks against victims\u2019 computer systems, denying victims access to their systems and data unless a ransom payment was made.</p>\n<p>The defendants victimized a broad range of organizations, including small businesses, government agencies, nonprofit programs and educational and religious institutions. Their victims also included multiple critical infrastructure sectors, including health care centers, transportation services and utility providers.</p>\n<p>\u201cRansom-related cyberattacks \u2014 like what happened here \u2014 are a particularly destructive form of cybercrime,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. \u201cNo form of cyberattack is acceptable, but ransomware attacks that target critical infrastructure services, such as health care facilities and government agencies, are a threat to our national security. Hackers like these defendants go to great lengths to keep their identities secret, but there is always a digital trail. And we will find it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI remains steadfast in our commitment to work with our U.S. government partners for the purpose of imposing cost on our adversaries,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cThis indictment, when coupled with other disruptive operational activities, demonstrates what\u2019s possible when we team up with our domestic and international partners and take a whole-of-government approach. We, along with our partners, remain dedicated to protecting the United States of America and the victims affected by these egregious crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, in February 2021, the defendants and their conspirators targeted a township in Union County, New Jersey. They exploited known vulnerabilities to gain control and access to the township\u2019s network and data and used a hacking tool to establish persistent remote access to a particular domain that was registered to Ahmadi.</p>\n<p>In or before February 2022, the defendants and their conspirators targeted an accounting firm based in Morris County, New Jersey. They again exploited a known vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and then used a particular hacking tool to establish a connection to a server that was registered to Nickaein and to steal data. In March 2022, the defendants launched an encryption attack against the accounting firm; after denying the firm access to some of its systems, Khatibi demanded payment of $50,000 in cryptocurrency and threatened to sell the data on the black market.</p>\n<p>The defendants also compromised, and often encrypted and extorted, hundreds of other victims, including an accounting firm based in Illinois; a regional electric utility company based in Mississippi; a regional electric utility company based in Indiana; a public housing corporation in the State of Washington; a shelter for victims of domestic violence in Pennsylvania; a County government in Wyoming; a construction company located in the State of Washington that was engaged in work on critical infrastructure projects; and a state bar association.</p>\n<p>Ahmadi, Khatibi and Nickaein, all residents of Iran, are each charged by indictment with one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers; one count of intentionally damaging a protected computer; and one count of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer. Ahmadi is charged with one additional count of intentionally damaging a protected computer. All defendants remain at large abroad.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The intentional damage to protected computers charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The transmission of a ransom demand charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The offenses also carry a potential maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross amount of gain or loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest.</p>\n<p>U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys David E. Malagold and Matthew Feldman Nikic for the District of New Newsey, and Trial Attorney Andrew D. Beaty of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Three Nigerian citizens were extradited from the United Kingdom (UK) and arrived in the United States in relation to their alleged participation in multimillion-dollar cyber-enabled business email compromise (BEC) fraud schemes in the Western District of North Carolina, Southern District of Texas and Eastern District of Virginia. The scams allegedly perpetrated by the defendants and their co-conspirators targeted unsuspecting victims including universities in North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, and attempted to cause more than $5 million in losses.</p>\n<p>BEC, also known as \u201ccyber-enabled financial fraud,\u201d is a sophisticated scam often targeting employees with access to company finances, businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments.\u00a0The same criminal organizations that perpetrate BEC also exploit individual victims, often real estate purchasers, the elderly, and others, by convincing them to make wire transfers to bank accounts controlled by the criminals. This is often accomplished by impersonating a key employee or business partner after obtaining access to that person\u2019s email account or sometimes done through romance and lottery scams. BEC scams may involve fraudulent requests for checks rather than wire transfers; they may target sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or employee tax records instead of, or in addition to, money; and they may not involve an actual \u201ccompromise\u201d of an email account or computer network.\u00a0Foreign citizens perpetrate many BEC scams.\u00a0Those individuals are often members of transnational criminal organizations, which originated in Nigeria but have spread throughout the world.</p>\n<p><em>Western District of North Carolina</em></p>\n<p>Oludayo Kolawole John Adeagbo aka John Edwards and John Dayo, 43, a Nigerian citizen and UK resident, and Donald Ikenna Echeazu aka Donald Smith and Donald Dodient, 40, a dual UK and Nigerian citizen, are charged with wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and aggravated identity theft for defrauding a North Carolina university (the University) of more than $1.9 million via a business email compromise scheme. The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in the Western District of North Carolina on April 17, 2019, and was unsealed yesterday following Echeazu\u2019s initial appearance in federal court in Charlotte.</p>\n<p>According to allegations contained in the indictment, from Aug. 30, 2016, to Jan. 12, 2017, Adeagbo and Echeazu conspired with other individuals to obtain information about significant construction projects occurring throughout the United States, including an ongoing multi-million-dollar project at the victim University. To execute the scheme, the defendants allegedly registered a domain name similar to that of the legitimate construction company in charge of the University\u2019s project and created an email address that closely resembled that of an employee of the construction company. Using the fake email address, the co-conspirators allegedly deceived and directed the University to wire a payment of more than $1.9 million to a bank account controlled by an individual working under the direction of defendants. Upon receiving the payment, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered the stolen proceeds through a series of financial transactions designed to conceal the fraud.</p>\n<p>The wire fraud conspiracy charge and the money laundering conspiracy charge each carry a maximum statutory sentence of 20 years in prison. The aggravated identity theft charge carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence consecutive to any other term imposed.</p>\n<p>The FBI Charlotte Field Office conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Graham Billings of the Western District of North Carolina is prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>Southern District of Texas</em></p>\n<p>Oludayo Kolawole John Adeagbo aka John Edwards and John Dayo, 43, a Nigerian citizen and UK resident, is also charged in the Southern District of Texas with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. A federal grand jury returned the indictment March 30, 2022, which was unsealed on Aug. 3, 2022 before he was extradited to the United States.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From November 2016 until July 2018, Adeagbo allegedly conspired with others to participate in cyber-enabled business email compromises in an attempt to steal more than $3 million from victims in Texas, including local government entities, construction companies and a Houston-area college.\u00a0The indictment alleges Adeagbo and his co-conspirators registered domain names that looked similar to legitimate companies. They then sent emails from those domains pretending to be employees at those companies, according to the charges. The conspirators allegedly sent emails to clients or customers of the companies they impersonated and deceived those customers into sending wire payments to bank accounts they controlled.</p>\n<p>Adeagbo faces up to 20 years in prison, if convicted on the charges.</p>\n<p>The FBI Houston Cyber Task Force conducted the investigation with the assistance of the FBI Cyber and Criminal Investigative Divisions. The United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency, Metropolitan Police Service, City of London Police and Crown Prosecution Service also provided substantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rodolfo Ramirez for the Southern District of Texas is prosecuting the case along with Trial Attorney Brian Mund of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS).</p>\n<p><em>Eastern District of Virginia</em></p>\n<p>Olabanji Egbinola, 42, is charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>\n<p>According to a criminal complaint issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, from Sept. 26, 2018, to Dec. 26, 2018, Egbinola is alleged to have conspired with others to defraud a Virginia-based university. Egbinola and co-conspirators created and used a fraudulent email account that incorporated the name of a construction company that had a large, ongoing contract with the university. Using this email account, Egbinola and co-conspirators deceived the university into transferring $469,819.49 to a bank account controlled by Egbinola and co-conspirators. That money was quickly laundered and transferred overseas through numerous transactions. Evidence obtained during the investigation showed that Egbinola repeatedly accessed the email account used to defraud the Virginia university.</p>\n<p>The FBI Richmond Division conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Hood of for the Eastern District of Virginia is prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>All three defendants were arrested April 23, 2020, by UK authorities at the request of the United States and ordered extradited on Sept. 3, 2021. All three defendants filed appeals, all of which were rejected by the UK High Court on July 12, 2022.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of all three defendants. The U.S. Marshals Service also assisted by transporting the defendants from the UK to the United States.</p>\n<p>Victims are encouraged to file a complaint online with the IC3 at <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice\">bec.ic3.gov</a>.\u00a0The IC3 staff reviews complaints, looking for patterns or other indicators of significant criminal activity, and refers investigative packages of complaints to the appropriate law enforcement authorities in a particular city or region.

These domains were \u201craidforums.com,\u201d \u201cRf.ws,\u201d and \u201cRaid.lol.\u201d According to the affidavit filed in support of these seizures, from in or around 2016 through February 2022, RaidForums served as a major online marketplace for individuals to buy and sell hacked or stolen databases containing the sensitive personal and financial information of victims in the United States and elsewhere, including stolen bank routing and account numbers, credit card information, login credentials and social security numbers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe takedown of this online market for the resale of hacked or stolen data disrupts one of the major ways cybercriminals profit from the large-scale theft of sensitive personal and financial information,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThis is another example of how working with our international law enforcement partners has resulted in the shutdown of a criminal marketplace and the arrest of its administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur interagency efforts to dismantle this sophisticated online platform \u2013 which facilitated a wide range of criminal activity \u2013 should come as a relief to the millions victimized by it, and as a warning to those cybercriminals who participated in these types of nefarious activities,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cOnline anonymity was not able to protect the defendant in this case from prosecution, and it will not protect other online criminals either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe seizure of the RaidForums website \u2013 which facilitated the sale of stolen data from millions of people throughout the world \u2013 and the charges against the marketplace's administrator are a testament to the strength of the FBI's international partnerships,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge Steven M. D\u2019Antuono of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office said. \u201cCybercrime transcends borders, which is why the FBI is committed to working with our partners to bring cybercriminals to justice \u2013 no matter where in the world they live or behind what device they try to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis global investigation signifies the remarkable dedication of the U.S. Secret Service and highlights our partnerships with our foreign law enforcement counterparts essential to disrupting sophisticated networks of cyber criminals,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Jason D. Kane of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThis case exemplifies teamwork at all levels of law enforcement to stop these cyber criminals from defrauding citizens of the United States and in our partner countries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prior to its seizure, RaidForums members used the platform to offer for sale hundreds of databases of stolen data containing more than 10 billion unique records for individuals residing in the United States and internationally. At the time of its founding in 2015, RaidForums also operated as an online venue for organizing and supporting forms of electronic harassment, including by \u201craiding\u201d \u2013 posting or sending an overwhelming volume of contact to a victim\u2019s online communications medium \u2013 or \u201cswatting\u201d \u2013 the practice of making false reports to public safety agencies of situations that would necessitate a significant, and immediate armed law enforcement response.</p>\n<p>The seizure of these domains by the government will prevent RaidForums members from using the platform to traffic in data stolen from corporations, universities and governmental entities in the United States and elsewhere, including databases containing the sensitive, private data of millions of individuals around the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition, a six-count indictment against Coelho was unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia charging him with conspiracy, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft in connection with his role as the chief administrator of RaidForums. According to the indictment, between Jan. 1, 2015, and on or about Jan. 31, 2022, Coelho allegedly controlled and served as the chief administrator of RaidForums, which he operated with the help of other website administrators. As administrators, Coelho and his co-conspirators are alleged to have designed and administered the platform\u2019s software and computer infrastructure, established and enforced rules for its users, and created and managed sections of the website dedicated to promoting the buying and selling of contraband, including a subforum titled \u201cLeaks Market\u201d that described itself as \u201c[a] place to buy/sell/trade databases and leaks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>To profit from the illicit activity on the platform, RaidForums charged escalating prices for membership tiers that offered greater access and features, including a top-tier \u201cGod\u201d membership status. RaidForums also sold \u201ccredits\u201d that provided members access to privileged areas of the website and enabled members to \u201cunlock,\u201d and download stolen financial information, means of identification, and data from compromised databases, among other items. Members could also earn credits through other means, such as by posting instructions on how to commit certain illegal acts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Coelho also personally sold stolen data on the platform, and directly facilitated illicit transactions by operating a fee-based \u201cOfficial Middleman\u201d service. For the Official Middleman service, Coelho allegedly acted as a trusted intermediary between RaidForums members seeking to buy and sell contraband on the platform, including hacked data. Notably, to create confidence amongst transacting parties, the Official Middleman service enabled purchasers and sellers to verify the means of payment and contraband files being sold prior to executing the transaction.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia; Special Agent in Charge Jason D. Kane of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division; and Assistant Director Steven M. D\u2019Antuono of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Senior Trial Attorney Aarash Haghighat of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carina A. Cuellar for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case against Coelho. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance throughout the criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>The law enforcement actions against RaidForums and Coelho are the result of an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and the U.S. Secret Service. The department also thanks the support provided by Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (Europol), National Crime Agency (UK), Swedish Police Authority (Sweden), Romanian National Police (Romania), Judicial Police (Portugal), Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) and other law enforcement partners.</p>\n<p>Anyone that has\u00a0any information regarding Coelho or RaidForums should file a complaint at\u00a0<a href=\"https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?data=04%7C01%7Csshero%40fbi.gov%7C20ebdd0c81854112262f08da18879c10%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C637849267951504601%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;reserved=0&amp;sdata=mNOuDsVUmyrUPMaTPCqk3p0t61K%2F3RsKBmdWZAP3VCg%3D&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fic3.gov%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3Dgovdelivery&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">ic3.gov</a>\u00a0with #RaidForums in the description.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department announced today the seizure of Hydra Market (Hydra), the world\u2019s largest and longest-running darknet market. In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace has received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>The seizure of the Hydra servers and cryptocurrency wallets containing $25 million worth of bitcoin was made this morning in Germany by the German Federal Criminal Police (the Bundeskriminalamt), in coordination with U.S. law enforcement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who violate our laws \u2013 no matter where they are located or how they try to hide their crimes,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cTogether with our German law enforcement partners, we have seized the infrastructure of the world\u2019s largest darknet market, but our work is far from over. We will continue to work alongside our international and interagency partners to disrupt and dismantle darknet markets, and to hold those who commit their crimes on the dark web accountable for their acts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Department of Justice will not allow darknet markets and cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering and the sale of hacking tools and services,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cOur message should be clear: we will continue to go after darknet markets and those who exploit them. Together with our partners in Germany and around the world, we will continue our work to disrupt the ecosystem that allows these criminal actors to operate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hydra was an online criminal marketplace that enabled users in mainly Russian-speaking countries to buy and sell illicit goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering and mixing services, anonymously and outside the reach of law enforcement. Transactions on Hydra were conducted in cryptocurrency and Hydra\u2019s operators charged a commission for every transaction conducted on Hydra.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the shutdown of Hydra, the department also announced criminal charges against Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, 30, a resident of Russia, for conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in connection with his operation and administration of the servers used to run Hydra.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis coordinated action sends a clear message to anyone attempting to operate or support an online criminal enterprise under the cover of the dark web,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds for the Northern District of California. \u201cThe dark web is not a place criminals can operate with impunity or hide from U.S. law enforcement, and we will continue to use our sophisticated tools and expertise to dismantle and disable darknet markets. This action also underscores the importance of international law enforcement collaboration. We thank German authorities and the Bundeskriminalamt, the German Federal Criminal Police Office, for its valued assistance in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe darknet has been a key online marketplace for the sale of deadly drugs worldwide,\u201d said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). \u201cThe availability of illicit substances and money laundering services offered by Hydra threaten the safety and health of communities far and wide. Criminals on the darknet hide behind the illusion of anonymity, but DEA and our partners across the globe are watching. We will continue to investigate, expose, and take action against criminal networks no matter where they operate. I commend the extraordinary investigative efforts of DEA\u2019s Miami Counternarcotic Cyber Investigations Task Force, Cyber Support Section, and Special Operations Division, and the teamwork from federal and international law enforcement partners that led to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hydra darknet site provided a platform for criminals who thought they were beyond the reaches of law enforcement to buy and sell illegal drugs and services,\u201d said Chief Jim Lee of IRS-Criminal Investigation. \u201cOur Cyber Crimes Unit once again used their cryptocurrency tracking expertise to help take down this site and identify the criminal behind it. Denying criminals a space to operate freely to conduct their nefarious activities is the first step in stopping this activity from happening altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe successful seizure of Hydra, the world's largest darknet marketplace, dismantled digital infrastructures which had enabled a wide range of criminals \u2013 including Russian cyber criminals, the cryptocurrency tumblers and money launderers that support them and others, and drug traffickers,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to the strength and potency of our law enforcement partnerships here and around the world \u2013 and another example of our strategy to broadly target the entire illicit ecosystem that drives and enables crime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service is dedicated to protecting the United States mail from being used to transport illegal drugs and illicit goods available on the darknet,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service National Headquarters. \u201cThe seizure of the criminal marketplace, Hydra Market, reflects the effective collaboration of law enforcement to stop criminal enterprises from their illicit activity. The Postal Inspection Service will continue to work with our federal partners to end these criminal organizations regardless of where they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web\u2019s largest supplier of illicit goods and services, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate with impunity,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami. \u201cHSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law enforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to manipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, vendors on Hydra could create accounts on the site to advertise their illegal products, and buyers could create accounts to view and purchase the vendors\u2019 products. Hydra vendors offered a variety of illicit drugs for sale, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD, heroin and other opioids. The vendors openly advertised their drugs on Hydra, typically including photographs and a description of the controlled substance. Buyers rated the sellers and their products on a five-star rating system, and the vendors\u2019 ratings and reviews were prominently displayed on the Hydra site.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hydra also featured numerous vendors selling false identification documents. Users could search for vendors selling their desired type of identification document \u2013 for example, U.S. passports or drivers\u2019 licenses \u2013 and filter or sort by the item\u2019s price. Many vendors of false identification documents offered to customize the documents based on photographs or other information provided by the buyers.</p>\n<p>Numerous vendors also sold hacking tools and hacking services through Hydra. Hacking vendors commonly offered to illegally access online accounts of the buyer\u2019s choosing. In this way, buyers could select their victims and hire professional hackers to gain access to the victims\u2019 communications and take over the victims\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p>Hydra vendors also offered a robust array of money laundering and so-called \u201ccash-out\u201d services, which allowed Hydra users to convert their bitcoin (BTC) into a variety of forms of currency supported by Hydra\u2019s wide array of vendors. In addition, Hydra offered an in-house mixing service to launder and then process vendors\u2019 withdrawals. Mixing services allowed customers, for a fee, to send bitcoin to designated recipients in a manner that was designed to conceal the source or owner of the bitcoin. Hydra\u2019s money laundering features were so in-demand that some users would set up shell vendor accounts for the express purpose of running money through Hydra\u2019s bitcoin wallets as a laundering technique.</p>\n<p>Starting in or about November 2015, Pavlov is alleged to have operated a company, Promservice Ltd., also known as Hosting Company Full Drive, All Wheel Drive and 4x4host.ru, that administered Hydra\u2019s servers (Promservice). During that time, Pavlov, through his company Promservice, administered Hydra\u2019s servers, which allowed the market to operate as a platform used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute large quantities of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to thousands of buyers, and to launder billions of dollars derived from these unlawful transactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As an active administrator in hosting Hydra\u2019s servers, Pavlov allegedly conspired with the other operators of Hydra to further the site\u2019s success by providing the critical infrastructure that allowed Hydra to operate and thrive in a competitive darknet market environment. In doing so, Pavlov is alleged to have facilitated Hydra\u2019s activities and allowed Hydra to reap commissions worth millions of dollars generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.</p>\n<p>The DEA\u2019s Miami Field Division, FBI, IRS-CI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and HSI investigated the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. investigation was conducted with support and coordination provided by the Department of Justice\u2019s multi-agency Special Operations Division and the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) Team.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys C. Alden Pelker and Christen M. Gallagher of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claudia A. Quiroz and Robert S. Leach for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>In addition to the critically important efforts of the German Federal Criminal Police, significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia. Assistance was also provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

In total, these hacking campaigns targeted thousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries.</p>\n<p>A June 2021 indictment returned in the District of Columbia, <em>United States v. Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh</em>, concerns the alleged efforts of an employee of a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute and his co-conspirators to damage critical infrastructure outside the United States, thereby causing two separate emergency shutdowns at a foreign targeted facility.

Alongside our partners here at home and abroad, the Department of Justice is committed\u00a0to exposing and holding accountable state-sponsored hackers who threaten our critical infrastructure with cyber-attacks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI, along with our federal and international partners, is laser-focused on countering the significant cyber threat Russia poses to our critical infrastructure,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cWe will continue to identify and quickly direct response assets to victims of Russian cyber activity; to arm our partners with the information that they need to deploy their own tools against the adversary; and to attribute the misconduct and impose consequences both seen and unseen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe face no greater cyber threat than actors seeking to compromise critical infrastructure, offenses which could harm those working at affected plants as well as the citizens who depend on them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cThe department and my office will ensure that those attacking operational technology will be identified and prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe potential of cyberattacks to disrupt, if not paralyze, the delivery of critical energy services to hospitals, homes, businesses and other locations essential to sustaining our communities is a reality in today\u2019s world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Duston Slinkard for the District of Kansas. \u201cWe must acknowledge there are individuals actively seeking to wreak havoc on our nation\u2019s vital infrastructure system, and we must remain vigilant in our effort to thwart such attacks. The Department of Justice is committed to the pursuit and prosecution of accused hackers as part of its mission to protect the safety and security of our nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition to unsealing these charges, the U.S. government is taking action to <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-083a?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">enhance private sector network defense efforts</a> and <a href=\"https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=73f0be82-2c6b867e-73f79a67-ac1f6b01771c-a72e8f7b8ceb667b&amp;q=1&amp;e=d2252912-db07-4b30-8381-4dbd442acfc0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frewardsforjustice.net%2Findex%2F%3Fjsf%3Djet-engine%3Arewards-grid%26tax%3Dcyber%3A857\">disrupt similar malicious activity</a>.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has already released numerous Technical Alerts, ICS Alerts and Malware Analysis Reports regarding Russia\u2019s malign cyber activities, including the campaigns discussed in the indictments.

The conspirators designed the Triton malware to prevent the refinery\u2019s safety systems from functioning (<em>i.e.</em>, by causing the ICS to operate in an unsafe manner while appearing to be operating normally), granting the defendant and his co-conspirators the ability to cause damage to the refinery, injury to anyone nearby, and economic harm. However, when the defendant deployed the Triton malware, it caused a fault that led the refinery\u2019s Schneider Electric safety systems to initiate two automatic emergency shutdowns of the refinery\u2019s operations. Between February and July 2018, the conspirators researched similar refineries in the United States, which were owned by a U.S. company, and unsuccessfully attempted to hack the U.S. company\u2019s computer systems.</p>\n<p>The three-count indictment alleges that Gladkikh was an employee of the State Research Center of the Russian Federation FGUP Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics\u2019 (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, hereinafter \u201cTsNIIKhM\u201d) Applied Developments Center (\u201c\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a,\u201d hereinafter \u201cADC\u201d).

Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov \u2013</em> <em>defendants undertook years-long effort to target and compromise computer systems of energy sector companies</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>On Aug. 26, 2021, a federal grand jury in Kansas City, Kansas, returned an indictment charging three computer hackers, all of whom were residents and nationals of the Russian Federation (Russia) and officers in Military Unit 71330 or \u201cCenter 16\u201d of the FSB, with violating U.S. laws related to computer fraud and abuse, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and causing damage to the property of an energy facility.</p>\n<p>The FSB hackers, Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov (\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u043a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0432), 36, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov (\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432), 42, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0422\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432), 39, were members of a Center 16 operational unit known among cybersecurity researchers as \u201cDragonfly,\u201d \u201cBerzerk Bear,\u201d \u201cEnergetic Bear,\u201d and \u201cCrouching Yeti.\u201d The indictment alleges that, between 2012 and 2017, Akulov, Gavrilov, Tyukov and their co-conspirators, engaged in computer intrusions, including supply chain attacks, in furtherance of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to maintain surreptitious, unauthorized and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies. Specifically, the conspirators targeted the software and hardware that controls equipment in power generation facilities, known as ICS or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the energy sector campaign involved two phases. In the first phase, which took place between 2012 and 2014 and is commonly referred to by cyber security researchers as \u201cDragonfly\u201d or \u201cHavex,\u201d the conspirators engaged in a supply chain attack, compromising the computer networks of ICS/SCADA system manufacturers and software providers and then hiding malware \u2013 known publicly as \u201cHavex\u201d \u2013 inside legitimate software updates for such systems. After unsuspecting customers downloaded Havex-infected updates, the conspirators would use the malware to, among other things, create backdoors into infected systems and scan victims\u2019 networks for additional ICS/SCADA devices. Through these and other efforts, including spearphishing and \u201cwatering hole\u201d attacks, the conspirators installed malware on more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including ICS/SCADA controllers used by power and energy companies.</p>\n<p>In the second phase, which took place between 2014 and 2017 and is commonly referred to as \u201cDragonfly 2.0,\u201d the conspirators transitioned to more targeted compromises that focused on specific energy sector entities and individuals and engineers who worked with ICS/SCADA systems. As alleged in the indictment, the conspirators\u2019 tactics included spearphishing attacks targeting more than 3,300 users at more than 500 U.S. and international companies and entities, in addition to U.S. government agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In some cases, the spearphishing attacks were successful, including in the compromise of the business network (<em>i.e.</em>, involving computers not directly connected to ICS/SCADA equipment) of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (Wolf Creek) in Burlington, Kansas, which operates a nuclear power plant. Moreover, after establishing an illegal foothold in a particular network, the conspirators typically used that foothold to penetrate further into the network by obtaining access to other computers and networks at the victim entity.</p>\n<p>During the Dragonfly 2.0 phase, the conspirators also undertook a watering hole attack by compromising servers that hosted websites commonly visited by ICS/SCADA system and other energy sector engineers through publicly known vulnerabilities in content management software. When the engineers browsed to a compromised website, the conspirators\u2019 hidden scripts deployed malware designed to capture login credentials onto their computers.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy\u2019s hacking campaign targeted victims in the United States and in more than 135 other countries.</p>\n<p>Akulov, Gavrilov and Tyukov are charged with conspiracy to cause damage to the property of an energy facility and commit computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Akulov and Gavrilov are also charged with substantive counts of wire fraud and computer fraud related to unlawfully obtaining information from computers and causing damage to computers. These offenses carry maximum sentences ranging from five to 20 years in prison. Finally, Akulov and Gavrilov are also charged with three counts of aggravated identity theft, each of which carry a minimum sentence of two years consecutive to any other sentence imposed.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Scott Rask, Christopher Oakley and Ryan Huschka forthe District of Kansas, and Counsel for Cyber Investigations Ali Ahmad and Trial Attorney Christine Bonomo of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case. The FBI\u2019s Portland and Richmond field offices conducted the investigation, with the assistance of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division.</p>\n<p>Numerous victims, including Wolf Creek and its owners Evergy and the Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, cooperated and provided invaluable assistance in the investigation.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>View the concurrent announcement\u00a0by the Department of State of\u00a0<a href=\"https://rewardsforjustice.net/index/?jsf=jet-engine:rewards-grid&amp;tax=cyber:857\">a $10 million reward</a>\u00a0for information leading to the arrest of a defendant or identification of other conspirators as part of its Rewards for Justice program.</p>\n<p>View the concurrent announcement by the\u00a0FBI, Department of Energy and Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of a \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-083a?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">Joint Cybersecurity Advisory</a>\u00a0containing technical details, indicators of compromise and mitigation measures.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A Canadian man was extradited yesterday from Canada to the United States on an indictment returned in the Middle District of Florida that charges him with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer arising from his alleged participation in a sophisticated form of ransomware known as NetWalker. NetWalker ransomware has targeted dozens of victims all over the world, including companies, municipalities, hospitals, law enforcement, emergency services, school districts, colleges, and universities. Attacks have specifically targeted the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking advantage of the global crisis to extort victims.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, 34, of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, from April through December 2020, conspired to and did intentionally damage a protected computer and transmit a ransom demand in connection with doing so. The indictment also alleges that the United States intends to forfeit more than $27 million, which is alleged to be traceable to proceeds of the offenses. The defendant will make his initial appearance today in federal court in Tampa before U.S. Magistrate Judge Julie S. Sneed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs exemplified by the seizure of cryptocurrency by our Canadian partners, we will use all legally available avenues to pursue seizure and forfeiture of the alleged proceeds of ransomware, whether located domestically or abroad,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe department will not cease to pursue and seize cryptocurrency ransoms, thereby thwarting the attempts of ransomware actors to evade law enforcement through the use of virtual currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRansomware is a multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprise that transcends physical and political boundaries. International collaboration is essential to identify the perpetrators of these sophisticated schemes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. \u201cThis case illustrates effective international law enforcement cooperation directed at identifying cybercriminals, holding them accountable for their alleged criminal actions, and recovering funds allegedly stolen from their victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis investigation is yet another example of the outstanding work conducted by the Tampa FBI Cyber program, the Middle District of Florida, the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, and our law enforcement partners around the world,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani of the FBI\u2019s Tampa Field Office. \u201cIt is also a reminder that the FBI continues to work tirelessly to identify, locate, and apprehend those who would prey upon the innocent and bring about justice for the citizens of the United States.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vachon-Desjardins was extradited to the United States pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and Canada. Pursuant to a request submitted by U.S. authorities, Canadian law enforcement officers arrested Vachon-Desjardins in Gatineau, Quebec, on Jan. 27, 2021, and executed a search warrant at Vachon-Desjardins\u2019s home in Gatineau. During the search, officers discovered and seized 719 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $28,151,582 as of today\u2019s date, and $790,000 in Canadian currency.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Tampa Field Office is investigating the case.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Sonia V. Jimenez of the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carlton C. Gammons and Suzanne Nebesky of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance in securing Vachon-Desjardin\u2019s arrest and extradition. The U.S. Marshals Service transported Vachon-Desjardins from Canada to the United States.</p>\n<p>The investigation benefited from law enforcement cooperation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police, Gatineau Police Service, and National Cybercrime Coordination Unit.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is\u00a0presumed innocent until proven guilty </i><em>beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law</em><i>.</i></p></div>",

U.S. Senior District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel will sentence Lieber at a later date that has not yet been scheduled. Lieber was indicted in June 2020 and was subsequently charged in a superseding indictment in July 2020.</p>\n<p>Lieber served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which received more than $15 million in federal research grants between 2008 and 2019. Unbeknownst to his employer, Harvard University, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at WUT and, later, a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015. China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to $150,000 and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. In 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied to federal authorities about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and his affiliation with WUT.</p>\n<p>In tax years 2013 and 2014, Lieber earned income from WUT in the form of salary and other payments made to him pursuant to the Strategic Scientist and Thousand Talents Contracts, which he did not disclose to the IRS on his federal income tax returns. Lieber, together with WUT officials, opened a bank account at a Chinese bank during a trip to Wuhan in 2012. Thereafter, between at least 2013 and 2015, WUT periodically deposited portions of Lieber\u2019s salary into that account. U.S. taxpayers are required to report the existence of any foreign bank account that holds more than $10,000 at any time during a given year by the filing an FBAR with the IRS. Lieber failed to file FBARs for the years 2014 and 2015.</p>\n<p>The charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of making and subscribing false income tax returns provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, one year of supervised release and a $100,000 fine. The charge of failing to file an FBAR provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Acting U.S. Attorney Mendell; National Security AAG Olsen; FBI SAC Bonavolonta; DCIS SAC Hegarty; NCIS SAC Wiest; HHS OIG SAC Coyne; and IRS CI SAC Simpson made this announcement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Casey of Mendell\u2019s National Security Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorney James R.

These individuals, sometimes referred to as money mules, receive money from fraud victims and forward the illicit funds, often to overseas perpetrators.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By receiving and transferring illicit funds, money mules facilitate a wide range of fraud schemes, including those that often predominately impact older Americans \u2014 like romance scams and lottery fraud \u2014 and those that target companies through business e-mail compromise schemes. Money mules also assist the theft of funds earmarked for pandemic relief, including unemployment insurance and small business loan funds. Some money mules are aware that their actions facilitate international fraud schemes. Others, however, first interact with fraud schemes as victims and may be unaware that their actions are furthering criminal activity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>U.S. law enforcement took action to address 4,750 money mules over the last 10 weeks; enforcement actions occurred in every state in the country. These actions more than doubled the number of actions taken during <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-law-enforcement-takes-action-against-approximately-2300-money-mules-global-crackdown-money\">last year\u2019s effort</a>. Agencies are also conducting outreach to educate the public about how fraudsters use money mules and how to avoid unknowingly assisting fraud by receiving and transferring money.</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout money mules, many foreign fraudsters targeting American consumers, businesses and pandemic relief funds could not reap the proceeds of their schemes,\u201d said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. \u201cThe department and its partners will use every tool at our disposal \u2014 consumer education, disruption and prosecution \u2014 to cripple foreign fraudsters\u2019 ability to get money from victims\u2019 pockets to perpetrators\u2019 bank accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Law Enforcement Actions</em></p>\n<p>The department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and the FBI led the initiative with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Other participating agencies were the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The campaign was conducted simultaneously with a <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/european-money-mule-action-leads-to-1-803-arrests\">Europol initiative</a>, the European Money Mule Action (EMMA). Additionally, in several districts, including the District of Arizona and the Northern District of Georgia, federal law enforcement have been working closely with their state and local law enforcement counterparts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis year\u2019s Money Mule Initiative successfully halted the activity of hundreds of money mules worldwide thanks to the persistence and partnership of the FBI and our federal, state, local and international partners,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director\u00a0Brian Turner of the FBI's\u00a0Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. \u201cMoney mules make it easier for criminals to hide their activity, and harder for law enforcement to follow their tracks. Today\u2019s announcement is an unmistakable warning for those who move money for criminal enterprises: even if you don\u2019t know you\u2019re committing a crime, acting as a money mule is illegal and punishable, and the FBI and our partners will use all available tools to disrupt the flow of funds to criminal networks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes great pride in our history of protecting the public from being deceived by scammers,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. \u201cWe work hard to safeguard vulnerable consumers through aggressive criminal investigations, as well as proactive consumer outreach, as part of\u00a0our mission to protect those who might fall victim to cleverly designed deceptive offers. The Money Mule Initiative is another example of our law enforcement commitment, and that of our law enforcement partners, to vigorously pursue individuals who knowingly or unknowingly participate in criminal activity of this nature; bring them to justice and stop them in their tracks from victimizing the American public.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thousands of actions taken by law enforcement ranged from warning letters to civil and administrative actions, to criminal prosecutions. Law enforcement served approximately 4,670 letters warning individuals that their actions were facilitating fraud schemes. These letters outlined the potential consequences for transferring money acquired illegally. Civil or administrative actions were filed against 11 individuals, and through seizures and voluntary return of funds, law enforcement obtained nearly $3.7 million in fraud proceeds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, more than 30 individuals were criminally charged for their roles in receiving and forwarding victim payments or otherwise laundering fraud proceeds. These cases included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Consumer Protection Branch and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California charged four individuals who laundered gift cards purchased by fraud victims.</li>\n<li>Two U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices, the District of Rhode Island and the Western District of Pennsylvania, indicted individuals who, among other conduct, personally collected money from grandparent scam victims.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Tennessee charged an individual who facilitated the theft of unemployment insurance funds.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York indicted a ring of individuals who laundered money for romance scams and business email compromise fraud schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The charges also consisted of cases brought against individuals who facilitated business email compromise schemes, including charges brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Eastern District of Wisconsin and the Western District of Kentucky. Additional charges were brought against money mules by U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of Georgia, the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the District of Nebraska.</p>\n<p>Criminal charges are merely allegations. Defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p><em>Community Outreach and Prevention</em></p>\n<p>Agencies also turned their attention to educating the public about how fraudsters recruit individuals to serve as money mules, signs of money mule activity and steps that should be taken if someone has unknowingly facilitated fraud by moving money.</p>\n<p>These efforts included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. Postal Inspection Service created fliers that were displayed in post offices across the country during the Money Mule Initiative.</li>\n<li>FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) released a <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211203\">money mule public service announcement</a>.</li>\n<li>The Department of Labor Office of Inspector General provided information about money mule activity to state work force agencies.</li>\n<li>The Department\u2019s Elder Justice Coordinators educated their communities about money mule\u2019s activity.</li>\n<li>Members of the Attorney General\u2019s Coronavirus Fraud Enforcement Task Force used outreach materials created by the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) to educate the public about the use of money mules to steal pandemic relief funds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other government agencies joining the public awareness effort included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which created new <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-money-mule-en-2108/\">money mule scam awareness materials</a>, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Community Living and AmeriCorps Seniors. By increasing awareness of money mule activity, these efforts and others sought to prevent individuals from becoming involved in money mule activity.</p>\n<p>For more information on money mules, please visit <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch/money-mule-initiative\">https://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch/money-mule-initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Information about the Department of Justice\u2019s Elder Fraud Initiative is available at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice\">www.justice.gov/elderjustice</a>.

Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe allegations illustrate how foreign disinformation campaigns operate and seek to influence the American public. The Department is committed to exposing and disrupting malign foreign influence efforts using all available tools, including criminal charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Kazemi and Kashian were part of a coordinated conspiracy in which Iranian hackers sought to undermine faith and confidence in the U.S. presidential election,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cWorking with others, Kazemi and Kashian accessed voter information from at least one state\u2019s voter database, threatened U.S. voters via email, and even disseminated a fictitious video that purported to depict actors fabricating overseas ballots. The United States will never tolerate any foreign actors\u2019 attempts to undermine our free and democratic elections. As a result of the charges unsealed today, and the concurrent efforts of our U.S. government partners, Kazemi and Kashian will forever look over their shoulders as we strive to bring them to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI remains committed to countering malicious cyber activity targeting our democratic process,\u201d said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \u201cWorking rapidly with our private sector and U.S. government partners and ahead of the election, we were able to disrupt and mitigate this malicious activity \u2013 and then to enable today\u2019s joint, sequenced operations against the adversary. Today\u2019s announcement shows what we can accomplish as a community and a country when we work together, and the FBI will continue to do its part to keep our democracy safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the indictment unsealed today:</p>\n<p><em><u>The Voter Intimidation and Influence Campaign</u></em></p>\n<p>Starting in approximately August 2020, and proceeding until November 2020, Kazemi, Kashian, and other co-conspirators began a coordinated, campaign to undermine faith and confidence in the 2020 presidential election (the \u201cVoter Intimidation and Influence Campaign\u201d) and otherwise sow discord within U.S. society. The Campaign had four components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In September and October 2020, members of the conspiracy conducted reconnaissance on, and attempted to compromise, approximately 11 state voter websites, including state voter registration websites and state voter information websites. Those efforts resulted in the successful exploitation of a misconfigured computer system of a particular U.S. state (\u201cState-1\u201d), and the resulting unauthorized downloading of information concerning more than 100,000 of State-1\u2019s voters.</li>\n<li>In October 2020, members of the conspiracy, claiming to be a \u201cgroup of Proud Boys volunteers,\u201d sent Facebook messages and emails (the \u201cFalse Election Messages\u201d) to Republican Senators, Republican members of Congress, individuals associated with the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, White House advisors, and members of the media. The False Election Messages claimed that the Democratic Party was planning to exploit \u201cserious security vulnerabilities\u201d in state voter registration websites to \u201cedit mail-in ballots or even register non-existent voters.\u201d The False Election Messages were accompanied by a video (the \u201cFalse Election Video\u201d) carrying the Proud Boys logo, which purported, via simulated intrusions and the use of State-1 voter data, to depict an individual hacking into state voter websites and using stolen voter information to create fraudulent absentee ballots through the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) for military and overseas voters.<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov#_ftn1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a></li>\n<li>Also in October 2020, the conspirators engaged in an online voter intimidation campaign involving the dissemination of a threatening message (the \u201cVoter Threat Emails\u201d), purporting to be from the Proud Boys, to tens of thousands of registered voters, including some voters whose information the conspiracy had obtained from State-1\u2019s website. The emails were sent to registered Democrats and threatened the recipients with physical injury if they did not change their party affiliation and vote for President Trump.</li>\n<li>On Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the conspirators sought to leverage earlier September and October 2020 intrusions into an American media company\u2019s (Media Company-1) computer networks. Specifically, on that day, the conspirators attempted to use stolen credentials to again access Media Company-1\u2019s network, which would have provided them another vehicle for further disseminating false claims concerning the election through conspirator-modified or created content. However, because of an earlier FBI victim notification, Media Company-1 had by that time mitigated the conspirators\u2019 unauthorized access and these log-in attempts failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><u>Background on Kazemi and Kashian</u></em></p>\n<p>Kazemi and Kashian are experienced Iran-based computer hackers who worked as contractors for an Iran-based company formerly known as Eeleyanet Gostar, and now known as Emennet Pasargad. Eeleyanet Gostar purported to provide cybersecurity services within Iran. Among other things, Eeleyanet Gostar is known to have provided services to the Iranian government, including to the Guardian Council.</p>\n<p>As part of his role in the Voter Intimidation and Influence Campaign, Kazemi compromised computer servers that were used to send the Voter Threat Emails, drafted those emails, and compromised the systems of Media Company-1. Kashian managed the conspirators\u2019 computer infrastructure used to carry out the Voter Threat Emails campaign and he purchased social media accounts in furtherance of the Voter Intimidation and Influence Campaign.</p>\n<p>Kazemi and Kashian are both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of voter intimidation, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison; and one count of transmission of interstate threats, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Kazemi is additionally charged with one count of unauthorized computer intrusion, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and one count of computer fraud, namely, knowingly damaging a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the unsealing of the indictment, the Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Emennet Pasargad, Kazemi, Kashian, and four other Iranian nationals comprising Emennet Pasargad leadership pursuant to Executive Order 13848, \u201cImposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election.\u201d Additionally, the Department of State\u2019s Rewards for Justice Program, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on or about the Kazemi and Kashian\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division and Cleveland Field Office are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dina McLeod and Louis A. Pellegrino and Trial Attorney Adam Small of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\u00a0 In actuality, the computer intrusions depicted in the False Election Video were simulated intrusions created by members of the conspiracy using their own server and data obtained during the State-1 exploitation. Further, the FVAP could not actually be leveraged in the manner implied by the False Election Video.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department announced today recent actions taken against two foreign nationals charged with deploying Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to attack businesses and government entities in the United States.</p>\n<p>An indictment unsealed today charges Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, a Ukrainian national, with conducting ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including the July 2021 attack against Kaseya, a multi-national information technology software company.</p>\n<p>The department also announced today the seizure of $6.1 million in funds traceable to alleged ransom payments received by Yevgeniy Polyanin, 28, a Russian national, who is also charged with conducting Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including businesses and government entities in Texas on or about Aug. 16, 2019.</p>\n<p>According to the indictments, Vasinskyi and Polyanin accessed the internal computer networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to encrypt the data on the computers of victim companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cCybercrime is a serious threat to our country: to our personal safety, to the health of our economy, and to our national security,\u201d said Attorney General Garland. \u201cOur message today is clear.\u00a0The United States, together with our allies, will do everything in our power to identify the perpetrators of ransomware attacks, to bring them to justice, and to recover the funds they have stolen from their victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur message to ransomware criminals is clear: If you target victims here, we will target you,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. \u201cThe Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware group attacks companies and critical infrastructures around the world, and today\u2019s announcements showed how we will fight back.\u00a0 In another success for the department\u2019s recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, criminals now know we will take away your profits, your ability to travel, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 your freedom. Together with our partners at home and abroad, the Department will continue to dismantle ransomware groups and disrupt the cybercriminal ecosystem that allows ransomware to exist and to threaten all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe arrest of Yaroslav Vasinskyi, the charges against Yevgeniy Polyanin and seizure of $6.1 million of his assets, and the arrests of two other Sodinokibi/REvil actors in Romania are the culmination of close collaboration with our international, U.S. government and especially our private sector partners,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe FBI has worked creatively and relentlessly to counter the criminal hackers behind Sodinokibi/REvil. Ransomware groups like them pose a serious, unacceptable threat to our safety and our economic well-being. We will continue to broadly target their actors and facilitators, their infrastructure, and their money, wherever in the world those might be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRansomware can cripple a business in a matter of minutes. These two defendants deployed some of the internet\u2019s most virulent code, authored by REvil, to hijack victim computers,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas. \u201cIn a matter of months, the Justice Department identified the perpetrators, effected an arrest, and seized a significant sum of money. The Department will delve into the darkest corners of the internet and the furthest reaches of the globe to track down cyber criminals.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2 ransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused the deployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused the Kaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to \u201cendpoints\u201d on Kaseya customer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the ransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on computers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.</p>\n<p>Through the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendants allegedly left electronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims\u2019 computers. The notes included a web address leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a publicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting either website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address to use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom amount, the defendants provided the decryption key, and the victims then were able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the ransom, the defendants typically posted the victims\u2019 stolen data or claimed they sold the stolen data to third parties, and victims were unable to access their files.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vasinskyi and Polyanin are charged in separate indictments with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, substantive counts of damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted of all counts, each faces a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively.</p>\n<p>The $6.1 million seized from Polyanin is alleged to be traceable to ransomware attacks and money laundering committed by Polyanin through his use of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware. The seizure warrant was issued out of the Northern District of Texas. Polyanin is believed to be abroad.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 8, Vasinskyi was taken into custody in Poland where he remains held by authorities pending proceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States, pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. In parallel with the arrest, interviews and searches were carried out in multiple countries, and would not have been possible without the rapid response of the National Police of Ukraine and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas and Senior Counsel Byron M. Jones from the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the FBI\u2019s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices, and the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section conducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust, who were an integral part of coordination. Investigators and prosecutors from several jurisdictions, including: Romania's National Police and the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism; Canada\u2019s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; France\u2019s Court of Paris and BL2C (anti-cybercrime unit police); Dutch National Police; Poland\u2019s National Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Border Guard, Internal Security Agency, and Ministry of Justice; and the governments of Norway and Australia provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Germany\u2019s Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office Stuttgart and State Office of Criminal Investigation of Baden-Wuerttemberg; Switzerland\u2019s Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office II of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich and Cantonal Police Z\u00fcrich; United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency; U.S. Secret Service; Texas Department of Information Resources; BitDefender; McAfee; and Microsoft also provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>This case is part of the Department of Justice\u2019s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion attacks. As part of the task force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their crimes. The department, through the task force, also strategically targets the ransomware criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force,\u00a0read\u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/1159691/dl?inline\">Deputy Attorney General\u2019s recent guidance\u00a0memo</a>\u00a0on\u00a0related investigations and cases.\u00a0For more resources on ransomware prevention and response, visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware\">StopRansomware.gov</a>.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A Russian national, residing in the Yakutsk region of Russia and in Southeast Asia, had his initial appearance in federal court today after his extradition from the Republic of Korea to the Northern District of Ohio to face charges for his alleged role in a transnational, cybercriminal organization.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Vladimir Dunaev, 38, was a member of a transnational, cybercriminal organization that deployed a computer banking trojan and ransomware suite of malware known as \u201cTrickbot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrickbot attacked businesses and victims across the globe and infected millions of computers for theft and ransom, including networks of schools, banks, municipal governments, and companies in the health care, energy, and agriculture sectors,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cThis is the second overseas Trickbot defendant arrested in recent months, making clear that, with our international partners, the Department of Justice can and will capture cyber criminals around the world. This is another success for the Department\u2019s recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in dismantling ransomware groups and disrupting the cybercriminal ecosystem that allows ransomware to exist and to threaten our critical infrastructure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is determined to utilize our unique tools and capabilities to disrupt transnational cybercriminal organizations, such as the group that developed and delivered Trickbot, and remains committed to imposing risk and consequence upon these criminals,\u201d said Deputy Director Paul Abbate of the FBI. \u201cPursuing cyber criminals requires considerable patience, expertise, and resources, but the FBI has a long memory and will ensure that these malicious actors cannot evade detection or avoid the full weight of law enforcement actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Trickbot malware was designed to steal the personal and financial information of millions of people around the world, thereby causing extensive financial harm and inflicting significant damage to critical infrastructure within the United States and abroad,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget M. Brennan of the Northern District of Ohio. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores the great lengths federal law enforcement officials and our international partners will go to hold these alleged cybercriminals accountable for their actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment reflects the dynamic landscape in which international criminals utilize sophisticated cyber methods to take advantage of and defraud, unsuspecting victims anywhere in the world,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Eric Smith of the FBI\u2019s Cleveland Field Office. \u201cThis multi-year investigation demonstrates the commitment by the FBI to aggressively pursue these individuals despite the complexity and global character cyber investigations can so often bring. The FBI encourages any victim of cyber fraud to file a report with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that beginning in November 2015, and continuing through August 2020, Dunaev and others stole money, confidential information, and damaged computer systems from unsuspecting victims, including individuals, financial institutions, school districts, utility companies, government entities, and private businesses. To perpetuate their criminal scheme, the defendants allegedly used a network of co-conspirators and freelance computer programmers, known as the Trickbot Group, to create, deploy, and manage the Trickbot malware, which infected millions of computers and computer systems worldwide.</p>\n<p>Dunaev is alleged to have been one such co-conspirator, working as a malware developer for the Trickbot Group. Dunaev allegedly performed a variety of developer functions in support of the Trickbot malware, including managing the malware\u2019s execution, developing popular browser modifications and helping to conceal the malware from detection by security software.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Justice Department\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">announced</a>\u00a0the arrest and arraignment of Alla Witte, a Latvian national charged for her role in the Trickbot Group.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the Trickbot malware was designed to capture online banking login credentials and harvest other personal information, including credit card numbers, emails, passwords, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses from infected computers through the use of web injects and keystroke logging. Later versions of Trickbot were adapted to facilitate the installation and use of ransomware.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendants used these stolen login credentials and other personal information to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign beneficiary accounts.</p>\n<p>Dunaev was extradited from the Republic of Korea on Oct. 20. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and multiple counts of wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft. If convicted of all counts, Dunaev faces a maximum penalty of 60 years\u2019 imprisonment. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Cleveland Field Office.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided invaluable assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Dunaev to the United States, with substantial support provided by the Republic of Korea.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel C.S. Heath of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Riedl and Duncan T. Brown of the Northern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>This case is part of the Department of Justice\u2019s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion attacks. As part of the Task Force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their crimes. The department, through the Task Force, also strategically targets the ransomware criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

The operation, which was conducted across the United States, Australia, and Europe, was a result of the continued partnership between JCODE and foreign law enforcement against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services. Operation Dark HunTor builds on the success of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/documents-related-september-22-2020-press-conference\">Operation DisrupTor</a> and the coordinated law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down\">takedown earlier this year of DarkMarket</a>, the world\u2019s then-largest illegal marketplace on the Darknet. At the time, German authorities arrested the marketplace\u2019s alleged operator and seized the site\u2019s infrastructure, providing investigators across the world with a trove of evidence. Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and JCODE have since been compiling intelligence packages to identify key targets.</p>\n<p>Following the DarkMarket takedown in January 2021, U.S. and international law enforcement agencies identified Darknet drug vendors and buyers, resulting in a series of complementary, but separate, law enforcement investigations. Operation Dark HunTor actions have resulted in the arrest of 150 alleged Darknet drug traffickers and other criminals who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Prior to, but in support of Operation Dark HunTor, Italian authorities also shut down the\u00a0DeepSea\u00a0and Berlusconi dark web marketplaces which boasted\u00a0over 40,000 advertisements of illegal products.\u00a0Four alleged\u00a0administrators were arrested,\u00a0and\u00a0\u20ac3.6 million in cryptocurrencies\u00a0were seized in coordinated U.S.-Italian operations.</p>\n<p>Operation Dark HunTor resulted in the seizure of over $31.6 million in both cash and virtual currencies; approximately 234 kilograms (kg) of drugs worldwide including 152.1 kg of amphetamine, 21.6 kg of cocaine, 26.9 kg of opioids, 32.5 kg of MDMA, in addition to more than 200,000 ecstasy, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methamphetamine pills, and counterfeit medicine ; and 45 firearms. Darknet vendor accounts were also identified and attributed to real individuals selling illicit goods on active marketplaces, as well as inactive Darknet marketplaces such as Dream, WallStreet, White House, DeepSea, and Dark Market.</p>\n<p>Operation Dark HunTor led to 65 arrests in the United States, one in Bulgaria, three in France, 47 in Germany, four in the Netherlands, 24 in the United Kingdom, four in Italy, and two in Switzerland. A number of investigations are still ongoing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis 10-month massive international law enforcement operation spanned across three continents and involved dozens of U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to send one clear message to those hiding on the Darknet peddling illegal drugs: there is no dark internet. We can and we will shine a light,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. \u201cOperation Dark HunTor prevented countless lives from being lost to this dangerous trade in illicit and counterfeit drugs, because one pill can kill.\u00a0The Department of Justice with our international partners will continue to crack down on lethal counterfeit opioids purchased on the Darknet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe men and women of the department\u2019s Criminal Division, in close collaboration with our team of interagency and international partners, stand ready to leverage all our resources to protect our communities through the pursuit of those who profit from addiction, under the false belief that they are anonymous on the Darknet,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0\u201cOnly through a whole of government and, in this case, global approach to tackling cyber-enabled drug trafficking can we hope to achieve the significant results illustrated in Operation Dark HunTor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI\u202fcontinues to identify and bring to justice drug dealers who believe they can hide their illegal activity through the Darknet,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u201cCriminal darknet markets exist so drug dealers can profit at the expense of others\u2019 safety. The FBI is committed to working with our\u202fJCODE and\u202fEUROPOL\u202flaw enforcement\u202fpartners to disrupt those markets and the\u202fborderless, worldwide trade in illicit drugs they enable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, we face new and increasingly dangerous threats as drug traffickers expand into the digital world and use the Darknet to sell dangerous drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine,\u201d said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). \u201cThese drug traffickers are flooding the United States with deadly, fake pills, driving the U.S. overdose crisis, spurring violence, and threatening the safety and health of American communities. DEA\u2019s message today is clear: criminal drug networks operating on the Darknet, trying to hide from law enforcement, can no longer hide. DEA, the U.S. interagency, and our valued international partners, are committed to dismantling drug networks wherever they are, including on the Darknet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIllicit darkweb marketplaces represent a significant threat to public health, economic, and national security,\u201d said Acting Director Tae Johnson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \u201cBy working collaboratively and sharing intelligence across local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and its partners are disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal organizations responsible for introducing dangerous narcotics and other contraband into our communities.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dark web has become an underground facilitator of illegal commerce,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). \u201cCriminals use the dark web to sell and ship narcotics and other dangerous goods around the world, often relying on the postal system and private carriers to deliver these illegal products. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to finding and stopping these drug traffickers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Darknet no longer provides a concealing cloak for criminals to operate,\u201d said IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Jim Lee. \u201cThe expertise of our agents and law enforcement partners helped uncover significant quantities of narcotics and money \u2014 both cash and virtual currency \u2014 derived from illicit means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point of operations such as the one today is to put criminals operating on the dark web on notice: the law enforcement community has the means and global partnerships to unmask them and hold them accountable for their illegal activities, even in areas of the dark web,\u201d said Europol\u2019s Deputy Executive Director of Operations Jean-Philippe Lecouffe.</p>\n<p>The extensive operation, which lasted 10 months, resulted in dozens of federal operations and prosecutions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Four search warrants were executed in furtherance of a multiagency investigation resulting in the seizure of approximately $1 million in drug proceeds (including approximately $700,000 in cryptocurrency), eight firearms, one vehicle, and various controlled substances including MDMA, LSD, and cocaine.\u00a0The FBI, DEA, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and USPIS jointly conducted the investigation.\u00a0According to court documents, the targets of the investigation were operating over multiple Darknet marketplaces to traffic methamphetamine, counterfeit pressed Adderall (containing methamphetamine), MDMA, cocaine, and ketamine to customers throughout the United States.\u00a0The investigation revealed that the organization\u2019s base of operations was in Houston, Texas, and the organization shipped to various cities throughout the United States. Six defendants are charged in a five-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of controlled substances, sale of counterfeit drugs, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>\n<li>The FBI in conjunction with the USPIS, FDA, and DEA, had been investigating a criminal enterprise that operated two Darknet vendor accounts. One of the accounts was operated out of the Miami area and the other out of the Providence, Rhode Island, area. According to court documents, the vendors, Luis Spencer, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Olatunji Dawodu, 36, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Alex Ogando, 35, of Providence, Rhode Island, allegedly advertised and sold pressed fentanyl pills throughout the United States. Agents identified several other co-conspirators and obtained search and arrest warrants for each. During the execution of the warrants, agents seized approximately $770,000, one weapon and approximately 3.5 kilograms of pressed fentanyl. Spencer, Dawodu, and Ogando are charged in the District of Columbia with conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of fentanyl.</li>\n<li>Kevin Olando Ombisi, 32, and Eric Bernard Russell Jr, 36, both of Katy, Texas, are alleged to have participated in Darknet controlled substances trafficking activities using the moniker Cardingmaster and are charged in a 10-count indictment in the Western District of Tennessee with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of controlled substances, attempted unlawful distribution of controlled substances, sale of counterfeit drugs, money laundering conspiracy, and mail fraud. According to court documents, Ombisi and Russell are alleged to have used the moniker Cardingmaster and conspired and attempted to, and did unlawfully distribute the Schedule II controlled substance methamphetamine, which was falsely represented to be Adderall, through the mail in the Western District of Tennessee and elsewhere. In conjunction with their arrests, the government seized more than $5 million in assets alleged to be connected to the drug trafficking activity. The case was investigated by the DEA, HSI, USPIS, and the FDA, and is being prosecuted by the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Tennessee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>An indictment and criminal complaint are merely allegations, and the defendants\u00a0are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p>\n<p>Operation Dark HunTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice; FBI; DEA; USPIS; ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); IRS-Criminal Investigation; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and the FDA\u2019s Office of Investigations.

VT-ICAC and HSI executed search warrants in one week on 15 residences based on cyber tips received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and leads developed through undercover investigation. Fiore\u2019s digital media, seized and searched by law enforcement, revealed that he paid a woman in Venezuela $4,000 to kidnap, torture, and murder a \u201cslave\u201d in Venezuela. According to the indictment, Fiore provided specific instructions about what he wanted, which included beating, burning with a cigarette, urinating and defecating on, and suffocating the so-called slave to death. Fiore requested a video of the torture and murder, which the woman sent to him over the internet.</p>\n<p>According to the plea agreement, Fiore\u2019s digital media also revealed that he paid the same woman $600 to create a video of her inflicting sexually motivated sadistic abuse on a child. The woman also created that video and sent it to Fiore online. In addition, Fiore possessed other images and videos depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including sexual intercourse and sadistic abuse.</p>\n<p>Fiore pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to kidnap or murder a person in a foreign country, conspiracy to produce child pornography, and possession of child pornography. He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 1, 2022, and faces a mandatory minimum penalty of 15 years in prison, and up to life. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors</p>\n<p>The woman who sent Fiore the videos, co-defendant Moraima Escarlet Vasquez Flores, is charged with conspiracy to murder and kidnap a person in a foreign country, conspiracy to produce child pornography, production of child pornography, and aiding and abetting the receipt of child pornography. Vasquez Flores was arrested in Colombia pursuant to an Interpol Red Notice on Sept. 18, 2020. The United States is seeking her extradition from Colombia to the United States to face these charges. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Masterson of the District of Vermont, Trial Attorney Patrick Jasperse of the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, and Trial Attorney Eduardo Palomo of the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section are prosecuting the case with the assistance of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\u00a0</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco announced today the creation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), to tackle complex investigations and prosecutions of criminal misuses of cryptocurrency, particularly crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors. Under the supervision of Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr., the NCET will combine s the expertise of the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and other sections in the division, with experts detailed from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices. The team will also assist in tracing and recovery of assets lost to fraud and extortion, including cryptocurrency payments to ransomware groups.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday we are launching the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to draw on the Department\u2019s cyber and money laundering expertise to strengthen our capacity to dismantle the financial entities that enable criminal actors to flourish \u2014 and quite frankly to profit \u2014 from abusing cryptocurrency platforms\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. \u201cAs the technology advances, so too must the Department evolve with it so that we\u2019re poised to root out abuse on these platforms and ensure user confidence in these systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Criminal Division is already an established leader in investigating and prosecuting the criminal misuse of cryptocurrency,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Polite. \u201cThe creation of this team will build on this leadership by combining and coordinating expertise across the Division in this continuously evolving field to investigate and prosecute the fraudulent misuse, illegal laundering, and other criminal activities involving cryptocurrencies.\u201d</p>\n<p>The head of the NCET will report to the Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division and will be selected after an application process seeking an individual with experience with complex criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Once selected, the Team Leader will lead the team of attorneys from MLARS, CCIPS, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) detailed from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country to identify, investigate, support, and pursue cases against cryptocurrency exchanges, infrastructure providers, and other entities that are enabling the misuse of cryptocurrency and related products to commit or facilitate criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the NCET will draw and build upon the established expertise across the Criminal Division to deter, disrupt, investigate, and prosecute criminal misuse of cryptocurrency, as well as to recover the illicit proceeds of those crimes whenever possible. Because cryptocurrency is used in a wide variety of criminal activity, from being the primary demand mechanism for ransomware payments, to money laundering and the operation of illegal or unregistered money services businesses, to being the preferred means of exchange of value on \u201cdark markets\u201d for illegal drugs, weapons, malware and other hacking tools, the NCET will foster the development of expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies across all aspects of the Department\u2019s work. The NCET will also play a critical support role for international, federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement authorities grappling with these new technologies and new forms of criminal tradecraft.</p>\n<p>National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team Details</p>\n<p>The NCET builds upon MLARS\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative and will be informed by the Department\u2019s Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework, released in October 2020. Because crimes involving cryptocurrency can take many forms, the NCET will not only pursue its own cases, but also support existing and future cases brought across the Criminal Division and in the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country.</p>\n<p>NCET team members will be drawn from three initial sources: MLARS, CCIPS, and detailees to the Criminal Division from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country. Team members will draw upon the expertise of their home offices while working collaboratively under the Team Leader to combine their expertise in financial systems, blockchain technology, tracing transactions, and applicable criminal statutes to address illegal activity involving cryptocurrency in a structured way. The NCET will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate and prosecute cryptocurrency cases, comprising a central part of a nationwide enforcement effort to combat the use of cryptocurrency as an illicit tool.</li>\n<li>Develop strategic priorities for investigations and prosecutions involving cryptocurrency, in consultation with the USAOs, Department components, and investigative agencies involved in cryptocurrency investigations.</li>\n<li>Identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, including professional money launderers, ransomware schemes, human traffickers, narcotics traffickers, and financial institutions working with cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>Build and enhance relationships with cryptocurrency focused AUSAs and prosecutors with other Department litigating components and offices to pursue cryptocurrency investigations and prosecutions.</li>\n<li>Develop and maintain relationships with federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies that investigate and prosecute cryptocurrency cases.</li>\n<li>Train and advise federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies in developing investigative and prosecutorial strategies. Such training and advice will include providing guidance concerning search and seizure warrants, restraining orders, criminal and civil forfeiture allegations, indictments, and other pleadings.</li>\n<li>Support the coordination and sharing of information and evidence among law enforcement offices to maximize the effectiveness of the Department\u2019s investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures involving cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>Collaborate and build relationships with private sector actors with expertise in cryptocurrency matters to further the criminal enforcement mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The NCET will work closely with other federal agencies, subject matter experts, and its law enforcement partners throughout the government.</p></div>",

Three of the four individuals charged were arrested today. The fourth defendant has not yet been arrested and is a fugitive on separate federal charges.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Ahmad \u201cAndy\u201d Khawaja, 49, of Los Angeles, California, and Thomas Wells, 74, of Martin County, Florida, are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Mohammad \u201cMoe\u201d Diab, 45, of Glendale, California, and Amy Ringler Rountree, 38, of Logan, Utah, are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Federal agents arrested Diab, Rountree, and Wells this morning. They are expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chicago, Illinois, respectively, later today or tomorrow. Khawaja is a fugitive from a December 2019 federal indictment filed in the District of Columbia that charges him, Diab, and others with campaign finance violations and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, executives of Allied Wallet Inc., a payment processing company headquartered in Los Angeles, secured payment processing for high-risk businesses through fraudulent misrepresentations about merchant clients. Khawaja served as Allied Wallet\u2019s owner and Chief Executive Officer, Diab served as the Chief Operating Officer, and Rountree served as Vice President of Operations. Allied Wallet provided services enabling merchant clients to accept debit and credit card payments over global electronic payment networks run by card brands such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Allied Wallet served as an intermediary between its merchant clients and financial institution members of the card brand networks. Wells, through his company Priority Payout, introduced merchant clients seeking payment processing to Allied Wallet.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Khawaja, Diab, Rountree, Wells, and others engaged in a scheme to defraud several financial institutions, the card brands, and others of money and property by fraudulently inducing them to provide payment processing services to merchants engaged in prohibited or high risk transactions, and to merchants that were terminated for fraud, chargeback, or other compliance concerns, through knowingly misrepresenting the types of transactions that the merchants were processing and the true identities of the merchants. The defendants and their co-conspirators accomplished the scheme through, among other steps, creating shell companies, designing fake websites that purported to sell low-risk retail and home goods, and using industry-standard codes that miscategorized the true nature of the transactions. Through the scheme, the defendants and their co-conspirators fraudulently obtained more than $150 million in payment card processing through more than 100 sham merchants.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

The indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, alleges that much of the conspiracy\u2019s theft was focused on information that was of significant economic benefit to China\u2019s companies and commercial sectors, including information that would allow the circumvention of lengthy and resource-intensive research and development processes. The defendants and their\u00a0Hainan State Security Department (HSSD)\u00a0conspirators sought to obfuscate the Chinese government\u2019s role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co., Ltd. (\u6d77\u5357\u4ed9\u76fe) (Hainan Xiandun), since disbanded, to operate out of Haikou, Hainan Province.</p>\n<p>The two-count indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang (\u4e01\u6653\u9633), Cheng Qingmin (\u7a0b\u5e86\u6c11) and Zhu Yunmin (\u6731\u5141\u654f), were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating, facilitating and managing computer hackers and linguists at Hainan Xiandun and other MSS front companies to conduct hacking for the benefit of China and its state-owned and sponsored instrumentalities. The indictment alleges that Wu Shurong (\u5434\u6dd1\u8363) was a computer hacker who, as part of his job duties at Hainan Xiandun, created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy\u2019s hacking campaign targeted victims in the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime. Stolen trade secrets and confidential business information included, among other things, sensitive technologies used for submersibles and autonomous vehicles, specialty chemical formulas, commercial aircraft servicing, proprietary genetic-sequencing technology and data, and foreign information to support China\u2019s efforts to secure contracts for state-owned enterprises within the targeted country (<em>e.g.</em>, large-scale high-speed railway development projects). At research institutes and universities, the conspiracy targeted infectious-disease research related to Ebola, MERS, HIV/AIDS, Marburg and tularemia.</p>\n<p>As alleged, the charged MSS officers coordinated with staff and professors at various universities in Hainan and elsewhere in China to further the conspiracy\u2019s goals. Not only did such universities assist the MSS in identifying and recruiting hackers and linguists to penetrate and steal from the computer networks of targeted entities, including peers at many foreign universities, but personnel at one identified Hainan-based university also helped support and manage Hainan Xiandun as a front company, including through payroll, benefits and a mailing address.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese criminal charges once again highlight that China continues to use cyber-enabled attacks to steal what other countries make, in flagrant disregard of its bilateral and multilateral commitments,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco.\u00a0\u201cThe breadth and duration of China\u2019s hacking campaigns, including these efforts targeting a dozen countries across sectors ranging from healthcare and biomedical research to aviation and defense, remind us that no country or industry is safe. Today\u2019s international condemnation shows that the world wants fair rules, where countries invest in innovation, not theft.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI, alongside our federal and international partners, remains committed to imposing risk and consequences on these malicious cyber actors here in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d\u00a0said Deputy Director Paul M. Abbate of the FBI. \u201cWe will not allow the Chinese government to continue to use these tactics to obtain unfair economic advantage for its companies and commercial sectors through criminal intrusion and theft. With these types of actions, the Chinese\u00a0government continues to undercut its own claims of being a trusted and effective partner in the international community.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment alleges a worldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign led by the government of China,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman for the Southern District of California. \u201cThe defendants include foreign intelligence officials who orchestrated the alleged offenses, and the indictment demonstrates how China\u2019s government made a deliberate choice to cheat and steal instead of innovate. These offenses threaten our economy and national security, and this prosecution reflects the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment and ability to hold individuals and nations accountable for stealing the ideas and intellectual achievements of our nation\u2019s best and brightest people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office is committed to protecting the people of the United States and the community of San Diego, to include our universities, health care systems, research institutes, and defense contractors,\u201d said Special Agent\u00a0in Charge Suzanne Turner of the FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office. \u201cThe charges outlined today demonstrate China\u2019s continued, persistent computer intrusion efforts, which will not be tolerated here or abroad. We stand steadfast with our law enforcement partners in the United States and around the\u00a0world and will continue to hold accountable those who commit economic espionage and theft of intellectual property.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The defendants\u2019 activity had been previously identified by private sector security researchers, who have referred to the group as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 40, BRONZE, MOHAWK, FEVERDREAM, G0065, Gadolinium, GreenCrash, Hellsing, Kryptonite Panda, Leviathan, Mudcarp, Periscope, Temp.Periscope and Temp.Jumper.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the conspiracy sent fraudulent spearphishing emails, that were buttressed by fictitious online profiles and contained links to\u00a0doppelg\u00e4nger domain names, which were created to mimic or resemble the domains of legitimate companies. In some instances, the conspiracy used hijacked credentials, and the access they provided, to launch spearphishing campaigns against other users within the same victim entity or at other targeted entities. The conspiracy also used multiple and evolving sets of sophisticated malware, including both publicly available and customized malware, to obtain, expand and maintain unauthorized access to victim computers and networks. The conspiracy\u2019s malware included those identified by security researchers as BADFLICK, aka GreenCrash; PHOTO, aka Derusbi; MURKYTOP, aka mt.exe; and HOMEFRY, aka dp.dll. Such malware allowed for initial and continued intrusions into victim systems, lateral movement within a system, and theft of credentials, including administrator passwords.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy often used anonymizer services, such as The Onion Router (TOR), to access malware on victim networks and manage their hacking infrastructure, including servers, domains and email accounts. The conspiracy further attempted to obscure its hacking activities through other third-party services. For example, the conspiracy used GitHub to both store malware and stolen data, which was concealed using steganography. The conspiracy also used Dropbox Application Programming Interface (API) keys in commands to upload stolen data directly to conspiracy-controlled Dropbox accounts to make it appear to network defenders that such data exfiltration was an employee\u2019s legitimate use of the Dropbox service.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with today\u2019s announcement, to enhance private sector network defense efforts against the conspirators, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-200a\">Joint Cybersecurity Advisory</a> containing these and further technical details, indicators of compromise and mitigation measures.</p>\n<p>The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California, the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Controls Section, and the FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Fred Sheppard and Sabrina Feve of the Southern District of California and Trial Attorney Matthew McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.</p>\n<p><em>The details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

A co-conspirator and California resident, also of Iran, faces additional structuring charges.",
    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A New York federal court unsealed an indictment today charging four Iranian nationals with conspiracies related to kidnapping, sanctions violations, bank and wire fraud, and money laundering. A co-conspirator and California resident, also of Iran, faces additional structuring charges.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Alireza Shavaroghi Farahani, aka Vezerat Salimi and Haj Ali, 50; Mahmoud Khazein, 42; Kiya Sadeghi, 35; and Omid Noori, 45, all of Iran, conspired to kidnap a Brooklyn journalist, author and human rights activist for mobilizing public opinion in Iran and around the world to bring about changes to the regime\u2019s laws and practices. Niloufar Bahadorifar, aka Nellie Bahadorifar, 46, originally of Iran and currently residing in California, is alleged to have provided financial services that supported the plot.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery person in the United States must be free from harassment, threats and physical harm by foreign powers,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThrough this indictment, we bring to light one such pernicious plot to harm an American citizen who was exercising their First Amendment rights, and we commit ourselves to bring the defendants to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, four of the defendants monitored and planned to kidnap a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin who has been critical of the regime\u2019s autocracy, and to forcibly take their intended victim to Iran, where the victim\u2019s fate would have been uncertain at best,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAmong this country\u2019s most cherished freedoms is the right to speak one\u2019s mind without fear of government reprisal. A U.S. citizen living in the United States must be able to advocate for human rights without being targeted by foreign intelligence operatives. Thanks to the FBI\u2019s exposure of their alleged scheme, these defendants have failed to silence criticism by forcible abduction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in this indictment, the government of Iran directed a number of state actors to plot to kidnap a U.S.-based journalist and American citizen, and to conduct surveillance on U.S. soil - all with the intention to lure our citizen back to Iran as retaliation for their freedom of expression,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cWe will use all the tools at our disposal to aggressively investigate foreign activities by operatives who conspire to kidnap a U.S. citizen just because the government of Iran didn\u2019t approve of the victim\u2019s criticism of the regime.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Farahani is an Iranian intelligence official who resides in Iran. Khazein, Sadeghi and Noori are Iranian intelligence assets who also reside in Iran and work under Farahani. Since at least June 2020, Farahani and his intelligence network have plotted to kidnap a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin (Victim-1) from within the United States in furtherance of the government of Iran\u2019s efforts to silence Victim-1\u2019s criticisms of the regime. Victim-1 is an author and journalist who has publicized the government of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses.</p>\n<p>Prior to the kidnapping plot, the government of Iran attempted to lure Victim-1 to a third country in order to capture Victim-1 for rendition to Iran. In approximately 2018, Iranian government officials attempted to induce relatives of Victim-1, who reside in Iran, to invite the victim to travel to a third country for the apparent purpose of having Victim-1 arrested or detained and transported to Iran for imprisonment. Victim-1\u2019s relatives did not accept the offer. An electronic device used by Farahani contains, among other things, a photo of Victim-1 alongside photos of two other\u00a0individuals, both of whom were lured from third countries and captured by Iranian intelligence, with one later executed and the other imprisoned in Iran, and a caption in Farsi that reads: \u201cgradually the gathering gets bigger... are you coming, or should we come for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>On multiple occasions in 2020 and 2021, as part of the plot to kidnap Victim-1, Farahani and his network procured the services of private investigators to surveil, photograph and video record Victim-1 and Victim-1\u2019s household members in Brooklyn. Farahani\u2019s network procured days\u2019 worth of surveillance at Victim-1\u2019s home and the surrounding area, videos and photographs of the victim\u2019s family and associates, surveillance of the victim\u2019s residence, and the installation of and access to a live high-definition video feed of Victim-1\u2019s home. The network repeatedly insisted on high-quality photographs and video recordings of Victim-1 and Victim-1\u2019s household members; a large volume of content; pictures of visitors and objects around the house; and depictions of Victim-1\u2019s body language. The network procured the surveillance by misrepresenting their identities and the purpose of the surveillance to the investigators, and laundered money into the United States from Iran to pay for the surveillance. Sadeghi acted as the network\u2019s primary point of contact with private investigators while Noori facilitated payment to the investigators in furtherance of the plot.</p>\n<p>As part of the kidnapping plot, the Farahani-led intelligence network also researched methods of transporting Victim-1 out of the United States for rendition to Iran. Sadeghi, for example, researched a service offering military-style speedboats for self-operated maritime evacuation out of New York City, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, a country whose de facto government has friendly relations with Iran. Khazein researched travel routes from Victim-1\u2019s residence to a waterfront neighborhood in Brooklyn;\u00a0the location of Victim-1\u2019s residence relative to Venezuela; and the location of Victim-1\u2019s residence relative to Tehran.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The network that Farahani directs has also targeted victims in other countries, including victims in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, and has worked to procure similar surveillance of those victims.</p>\n<p>As alleged, Bahadorifar provided financial and other services from the United States to Iranian residents and entities, including to Khazein, since approximately 2015. Bahadorifar facilitated access to the U.S. financial system and institutions through the use of card accounts and offered to manage business interests in the United States on Khazein\u2019s behalf. Among other things, Bahadorifar caused a payment to be made to a private investigator for surveillance of Victim-1 on Khazein\u2019s behalf. While Bahadorifar is not charged with participating in the kidnapping conspiracy, she is alleged to have provided financial services that supported the plot and is charged with conspiring to violate sanctions against Iran, commit bank and wire fraud, and commit money laundering. Bahadorifar is also charged with structuring cash deposits totaling more than approximately $445,000.</p>\n<p>Farahani, Khazein, Sadeghi and Noori are each charged with: (1) conspiring to kidnap, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison; (2) conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and sanctions against the government of Iran, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; (3) conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; and (4) conspiring to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Bahadorifar is charged with counts two, three and four, and is further charged with structuring, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s New York Field Office, Counterintelligence-Cyber Division and Iran Threat Task Force are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Nathan Swinton of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael D. Lockard, Jacob H. Gutwillig and Matthew J.C. Hellman of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A Latvian national was arraigned in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, today on multiple charges stemming from her alleged role in a transnational cybercrime organization responsible for creating and deploying a computer banking trojan and ransomware suite of malware known as \u201cTrickbot.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alla Witte, aka Max, 55, is charged in 19 counts of a 47-count indictment, which accuses her of participating in a criminal organization referred to as the \u201cTrickbot Group,\u201d which deployed the Trickbot malware. The Trickbot Group operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname, and primarily targeted victim computers belonging to businesses, entities, and individuals, including those in the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere in the United States. Targets included hospitals, schools, public utilities, and governments. Witte, who previously resided in Paramaribo, Suriname, was arrested on Feb. 6, in Miami, Florida.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment demonstrates the broad reach of the Department of Justice\u2019s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cTrickbot infected millions of victim computers worldwide and was used to harvest banking credentials and deliver ransomware. The defendant is accused of working with others in the transnational criminal organization to develop and deploy a digital suite of malware tools used to target businesses and individuals all over the world for theft and ransom. These charges serve as a warning to would-be cybercriminals that the Department of Justice, through the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force and alongside our partners, will use all the tools at our disposal to disrupt the cybercriminal ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Trickbot malware was designed to steal the personal and financial information of millions of people around the world, thereby causing extensive financial harm and inflicting significant damage to critical infrastructure within the United States and abroad,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget M. Brennan of the Northern District of Ohio. \u201cFederal law enforcement, along with assistance provided by international partners, continue to fight and disrupt ransomware and malware where feasible. We are united in our efforts to hold transnational hackers accountable for their actions.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWitte and her associates are accused of infecting tens of millions of computers worldwide, in an effort to steal financial information to ultimately siphon off millions of dollars through compromised computer systems,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Eric B. Smith of the FBI\u2019s Cleveland Field Office. \u201cCyber intrusions and malware infections take significant time, expertise, and investigative effort, but the FBI will ensure these hackers are held accountable, no matter where they reside or how anonymous they think they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that beginning in November\u00a02015, Witte and others stole money and confidential information from unsuspecting victims, including businesses and their financial institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and Russia through the use of the Trickbot malware.</p>\n<p>Witte and her co-conspirators allegedly worked together to infect victim computers with the Trickbot malware designed to capture online banking login credentials and harvest other personal information, including credit card numbers, emails, passwords, dates of birth, social security numbers and addresses. Witte and others also allegedly captured login credentials and other stolen personal information to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign beneficiary accounts.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Witte worked as a malware developer for the Trickbot Group and wrote code related to the control, deployment, and payments of ransomware. The ransomware informed victims that their computer was encrypted, and that they would need to purchase special software through a Bitcoin address controlled by the Trickbot Group to decrypt their files. In addition, Witte allegedly provided code to the Trickbot Group that monitored and tracked authorized users of the malware and developed tools and protocols to store stolen login credentials.</p>\n<p>Witte is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft; one count of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud affecting a financial institution; eight counts of bank fraud affecting a financial institution; eight counts of aggravated identity theft and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The defendant was arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge William H. Baughman\u00a0Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. If convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft; 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud; 30 years in prison for each substantive bank fraud count; a two-year mandatory sentence for each aggravated identity theft count, which must be served consecutively to any other sentence; and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Cleveland Office investigated the case.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel C.S. Heath of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Riedl and Duncan T. Brown of the Northern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>This case is part of the Department of Justice\u2019s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion attacks. As part of the Task Force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their crimes. The department, through the Task Force, also strategically targets the ransomware criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\u00a0</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</i></p></div>",

That indictment was unsealed and made public today upon Kingsbury\u2019s arrest and initial court appearance in the District of Kansas.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs an intelligence analyst for the FBI, the defendant was entrusted with access to sensitive government materials,\" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cKingsbury is alleged to have violated our nation\u2019s trust by stealing and retaining classified documents in her home for years. Insider threats are a significant danger to our national security, and we will continue to work relentlessly to identify, pursue and prosecute individuals who pose such a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe breadth and depth of classified national security information retained by the defendant for more than a decade is simply astonishing,\u201d said Alan E. Kohler, Jr. Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe defendant, who's well trained in handling classified information, put her country\u2019s sensitive secrets at risk. The FBI will go to great lengths to investigate individuals who put their own interests above U.S. national security, including when the individual is an FBI employee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur community\u2019s safety and our nation\u2019s security were jeopardized by this criminal behavior,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore for the Western District of Missouri. \u201cThose entrusted with such grave responsibility must be held accountable if they violate their oath and betray their country. I appreciate the diligence and professionalism with which the FBI thoroughly investigated one of their own and brought the perpetrator to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery FBI employee swears to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Timothy Langan of the FBI Kansas City Field Office. \u201cWith that oath comes the obligation to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure to safeguard our national security. Kingsbury\u2019s actions are a betrayal of trust not only to the FBI but also the American people. They can be reassured that the FBI takes any and all allegations of wrongdoing by employees with the utmost gravity and remain committed to investigating these allegations to the fullest extent.\u201d</p>\n<p>The federal indictment alleges that Kingsbury improperly removed sensitive government materials \u2013 including national defense information and classified documents \u2013 from June 2004 to Dec. 15, 2017. Kingsbury allegedly retained these materials in her personal residence.</p>\n<p>Kingsbury worked as an intelligence analyst for more than 12 years in the Kansas City Division of the FBI, until she was placed on suspension in December 2017. She was assigned to several different FBI squads during that time, including squads that focused on illegal drug trafficking, violent crime, violent gangs, and counterintelligence. Kingsbury, who held a top secret security clearance, had access to national defense and classified information.</p>\n<p>The federal indictment charges Kingsbury with two counts of having unauthorized possession of documents relating to the national defense.</p>\n<p>Count one of the federal indictment relates to numerous documents classified at the secret level that describe intelligence sources and methods related to U.S. government efforts to defend against counterterrorism, counterintelligence and cyber threats. The documents include details on the FBI\u2019s nationwide objectives and priorities, including specific open investigations across multiple field offices. In addition, there are documents relating to sensitive human source operations in national security investigations, intelligence gaps regarding hostile foreign intelligence services and terrorist organizations, and the technical capabilities of the FBI against counterintelligence and counterterrorism targets.</p>\n<p>Count two of the federal indictment relates to numerous documents classified at the secret level that describe intelligence sources and methods related to U.S. government efforts to collect intelligence on terrorist groups. The documents include information about al Qaeda members on the African continent, including a suspected associate of Usama bin Laden. In addition, there are documents regarding the activities of emerging terrorists and their efforts to establish themselves in support of al Qaeda in Africa.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Kingsbury was not authorized to remove and retain these sensitive government materials, nor did she have a need to know most, if not all, of the information contained in those materials. Kingsbury knew the unauthorized removal of classified materials and transportation and storage of those materials in unauthorized locations risked disclosure and transmission of those materials, and therefore could endanger the national security of the United States and the safety of its citizens. She also knew that violating the rules governing the handling of classified information could result in criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>The charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick C. Edwards and David Raskin in the Western District of Missouri, with the assistance of DOJ Trial Attorney Scott Claffee with the Counterintelligence &amp; Export Control Section of the National Security Division. It was investigated by the FBI Field Office in Omaha, Nebraska.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Department of Justice announced an update today on criminal and civil enforcement efforts to combat COVID-19 related fraud, including schemes targeting the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program and Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs.</p>\n<p>As of today, the Department of Justice has publicly charged 474 defendants with criminal offenses based on fraud schemes connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. These cases involve attempts to obtain over $569 million from the U.S. government and unsuspecting individuals through fraud and have been brought in 56 federal districts around the country. These cases reflect a degree of reach, coordination, and expertise that is critical for enforcement efforts against COVID-19 related fraud to have a meaningful impact and is also emblematic of the Justice Department\u2019s response to criminal wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Department of Justice has led an historic enforcement initiative to detect and disrupt COVID-19 related fraud schemes,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe impact of the department\u2019s work to date sends a clear and unmistakable message to those who would exploit a national emergency to steal taxpayer-funded resources from vulnerable individuals and small businesses. We are committed to protecting the American people and the integrity of the critical lifelines provided for them by Congress, and we will continue to respond to this challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo anyone thinking of using the global pandemic as an opportunity to scam and steal from hardworking Americans, my advice is simple \u2013 don\u2019t,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cNo matter where you are or who you are, we will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will not allow American citizens or the critical benefits programs that have been created to assist them to be preyed upon by those seeking to take advantage of this national emergency,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cWe are proud to work with our law enforcement partners to hold wrongdoers accountable and to safeguard taxpayer funds.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>In March 2020, Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic relief bill known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anticipating the need to protect the integrity of these taxpayer funds and to otherwise protect Americans from fraud related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Justice immediately stood up multiple efforts dedicated to identifying, investigating, and prosecuting such fraud. Leveraging data analysis capabilities and partnerships developed through its vast experience combatting economic crime and fraud on government programs, the Justice Department\u2019s response to COVID-19 related fraud serves as a model for proactive, high-impact white-collar enforcement, and demonstrates our agility in responding to new and emerging threats. This rapid and nationwide response enabled the Justice Department to quickly ensure accountability for wrongdoing amid a national crisis and sent a forceful message of deterrence during an ongoing crisis. The multifaceted and multi-district approach to enforcement during this national health emergency continues and is expected to yield numerous additional criminal and civil enforcement actions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>On criminal matters, the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to combat COVID-19 related fraud schemes have proceeded on numerous fronts, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) fraud:\u00a0</strong>Prominent among the department\u2019s efforts have been cases brought by the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud\">Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section</a> involving at least 120 defendants charged with PPP fraud. The cases involve a range of conduct, from individual business owners who have inflated their payroll expenses to obtain larger loans than they otherwise would have qualified for, to serial fraudsters who revived dormant corporations and purchased shell companies with no actual operations to apply for multiple loans falsely stating they had significant payroll, to organized criminal networks submitting identical loan applications and supporting documents under the names of different companies.\u00a0Most charged defendants have misappropriated loan proceeds for prohibited purposes, such as the purchase of houses, cars, jewelry, and other luxury items.\u00a0In one case, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/texas-man-pleads-guilty-24-million-covid-relief-fraud-scheme\"><em>U.S. v. Dinesh Sah</em></a>, in the Northern District of Texas, the defendant applied for 15 different PPP loans to eight different lenders, using 11 different companies, seeking a total of $24.8 million.\u00a0The defendant obtained approximately $17.3 million and used the proceeds to purchase multiple homes, jewelry, and luxury vehicles.\u00a0In another case, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-additional-members-los-angeles-based-fraud-ring-indicted-exploiting-covid-relief\"><em>U.S. v. Richard Ayvazyan, et al.</em></a>, in the Central District of California, eight defendants applied for 142 PPP and EIDL loans seeking over $21 million using stolen and fictitious identities and sham companies, and laundered the proceeds through a web of bank accounts to purchase real estate, securities, and jewelry.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) fraud:\u00a0</strong>The department has also focused on fraud against the EIDL program, which was designed to provide loans to small businesses, agricultural and non-profit entities. Fraudsters have targeted the program by applying for EIDL advances and loans on behalf of ineligible newly-created, shell, or non-existent businesses, and diverting the funds for illegal purposes. The department has responded, primarily through the efforts of the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-co\">U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado</a> and their partners at the U.S. Secret Service, acting swiftly to seize loan proceeds from fraudulent applications, with $580 million seized to date and seizures ongoing. The EIDL Fraud Task Force in Colorado, comprised of personnel from five federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors, is investigating a broad swath of allegedly fraudulently loans and their applicants. It is working to identify individual wrongdoers and networks of fraudsters appropriate for prosecution.</li>\n<li><strong>Unemployment Insurance (UI) fraud:</strong> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than $860 billion in federal funds has been appropriated for UI benefits through September 2021. Early investigation and analysis indicate that international organized criminal groups have targeted these funds by using stolen identities to file for UI benefits. Domestic fraudsters, ranging from identity thieves to prison inmates, have also committed UI fraud. In response, the department established the National Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force, a prosecutor-led multi-agency task force with representatives from more than eight different federal law enforcement agencies. Additionally, the department is hiring Assistant U.S. Attorneys in multiple U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices whose focus will be UI fraud prosecutions. Since the start of the pandemic, over 140 defendants have been charged and arrested for federal offenses related to UI fraud. In one case, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/russell-co-woman-pleads-guilty-499000-unemployment-fraud-scheme\"><em>U.S. v. Leelynn Danielle Chytka</em></a>, in the Western District of Virginia, a defendant recently pleaded guilty for her role in a scheme that successfully stole more than $499,000 in UI benefits using the identities of individuals ineligible for UI, including a number of prisoners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the department\u2019s International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal-opdat/2020-ichip-activities\">(ICHIP) program</a>, ICHIP advisors have provided assistance and case-based mentoring to foreign counterparts around the globe to help detect, investigate and prosecute fraud related to the pandemic. The ICHIPs have helped counterparts combat cyber-enabled crime (e.g., online fraud) and intellectual property crime, including fraudulent and mislabeled COVID-19 treatments and sales of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. ICHIPs conducted webinars for foreign prosecutors and law enforcement in Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America on how to take down fraudulent COVID-19 websites.\u00a0These webinars addressed methods for finding the registrar for a particular domain and requesting a voluntary takedown as well as the U.S. legal processes necessary for obtaining a court order that would bind a U.S. registrar. This has resulted in the take down of multiple online COVID-19 scams and significant seizures of counterfeit medicines and medical supplies such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and other illicit goods.</p>\n<p>The department has also brought actions to combat coronavirus-related fraud schemes targeting American consumers. With scammers around the world attempting to sell fake and unlawful cures, treatments, and personal protective equipment, the department has brought dozens of civil and criminal enforcement actions to safeguard Americans\u2019 health and economic security. The department has prosecuted or secured civil injunctions against dozens of defendants who sold products \u2014 including industrial bleach, ozone gas, vitamin supplements, and colloidal silver ointments \u2014 using false or unapproved claims about the products\u2019 abilities to prevent or treat COVID-19 infections. The department has also worked to shutter hundreds of fraudulent websites that were facilitating consumer scams, and it has taken scores of actions to disrupt financial networks supporting such scams. The department is also coordinating with numerous agency partners to prevent and deter vaccine-related fraud.</p>\n<p>The department is also using numerous civil tools to address fraud in connection with CARES Act programs. For example, in the Eastern District of California, the department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/eastern-district-california-obtains-nation-s-first-civil-settlement-fraud-cares-act\">obtained the first civil settlement for fraud involving the Paycheck Protection Program</a>, resolving civil claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) and the False Claims Act (FCA) against an internet retail company and its president and chief executive officer arising from false statements to federally insured banks to influence those banks to approve, and the SBA to guarantee, a PPP loan. FIRREA allows the government to impose civil penalties for violations of enumerated federal criminal statutes, including those that affect federally-insured financial institutions. The FCA is the government\u2019s primary civil tool to redress false claims for federal funds and property involving a multitude of government operations and functions. The FCA permits private citizens with knowledge of fraud against the government to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the United States and to share in any recovery. Such whistleblower complaints have been on the rise as unscrupulous actors take advantage of vulnerabilities created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the new government programs disbursing federal relief, and whistleblower cases will continue to be an essential source of new leads to help root out the misuse and abuse of taxpayer funds.</p>\n<p>Indictments and other criminal charges referenced above are merely allegations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The unprecedented pace and tempo of these efforts is made possible only through the diligent work of a wide range of Justice Department partners, including the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Civil Division\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and Consumer Protection Branch, U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country, and law enforcement partners from the FBI, Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, U.S. Secret Service, IRS-Criminal Investigation, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Offices of Inspectors General from the Small Business Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Social Security Administration, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Housing Finance Agency and Federal Reserve Board, Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, \u00a0Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, OCDETF Fusion Center and OCDETF\u2019s International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To learn more about the department\u2019s COVID response, visit: <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus\">https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus</a>.

For a fee, Muzhuk and Vorontsov provided a network of drop accounts and money mules to receive, transfer, and conceal money derived from the fraudulent online transfers of funds. The indictment alleges the conspiracy existed for the entirety of 2017 and focused on seven electronic funds transfers in October and November 2017, totaling almost $500,000.</p>\n<p>During the FBI\u2019s investigation of Muzhuk and Vorontsov, the Czech National Organized Crime Agency (NCOZ) collaborated to gather information and evidence. In late January 2020, NCOZ informed the FBI that Muzhuk was visiting Vorontsov at his residence in the Czech Republic. A criminal complaint and an arrest warrant were issued by a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Dallas and an FBI special agent from Dallas traveled to the Czech Republic to coordinate with the NCOZ.</p>\n<p>In an unprecedentedly prompt response on Feb. 6, 2020, the NCOZ effected the arrests of Muzhuk and Vorontsov at the request of the U.S. and seized valuable evidence from both defendants and from Vorontsov\u2019s residence. Muzhuk and Vorontsov were detained pending the extradition proceedings. On Dec. 4, 2020, and Jan. 21, 2021, respectively, the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic granted the extradition of Muzhuk and Vorontsov.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A citizen of Sweden pleaded guilty\u00a0to securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering charges that defrauded more than 3,500 victims of more than $16 million.</p>\n<p>Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 47, and his company, Eastern Metal Securities (EMS), was charged in a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-cryptocurrency-fraudster-arrested-thailand-charged-multi-million-dollar-investment\">criminal complaint</a> filed March 4, 2019, with crimes involving a scheme to defraud victims of more than $16 million. Karlsson, also known by several aliases including Steve Heyden, Euclid Deodoris, Joshua Millard, Lars Georgsson, Paramon Larasoft, and Kenth Westerberg, was arrested on June 17, 2019, in Thailand and was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-cryptocurrency-fraudster-extradited-thailand-face-charges-multi-million-dollar\">extradited to the United States to face the charges</a>. A federal grand jury indicted Karlsson and EMS on July 25, 2019.\u00a0Karlsson pleaded guilty to all the charges pending against him. EMS has ceased to exist.</p>\n<p>The indictment and a factual basis filed by the government describe a long-running scheme by which Karlsson and EMS used a website to commit wire fraud against thousands of victims. \u00a0Specifically, the indictment explains that from Nov. 27, 2012, through June 19, 2019, Karlsson and EMS used <a href=\"http://www.easternmetalsecurities.com\">www.easternmetalsecurities.com</a> to make fraudulent representations and convince victims to send funds using a virtual currency exchange. During the same period, Karlsson and EMS used deceptive \u201cdevices and contrivances\u201d to sell securities and then tried to conceal the proceeds of the wire fraud and securities fraud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the\u00a0proceedings, Karlsson admitted that he used the website to invite potential investors to purchase shares of the plan for less than $100 per share, promising an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share, an amount of gold which as of Jan. 2, 2019,\u00a0 was worth more than $45,000. Karlsson advised investors that, in the unlikely event that the gold payout did not happen, he guaranteed to them 97% of the amount they invested. Karlsson admitted he had no way to pay off the investors. Instead, the funds provided by victims were transferred to Karlsson\u2019s personal bank accounts and he then used proceeds to purchase expensive homes and a resort in Thailand.</p>\n<p>As the government has alleged, Karlsson also used a second website, <a href=\"http://www.hci25.com\">www.hci25.com</a>, to make multiple false communications to potential investors. Karlsson brought the investors in HCI25 together with the investors in the\u00a0\u201cPre Funded Reversed Pension Plan\u201d (PFRPP) and posted multiple communications to delay the moment investors would realize there would be no payout.\u00a0 For example, on one occasion, Karlsson explained that a payout had not occurred because releasing so much money all at once could cause a negative effect on financial systems throughout the world.\u00a0 Karlsson also falsely represented that EMS was working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare the way for a payout.</p>\n<p>Karlsson directed his victims to make investments using virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin.\u00a0 Karlsson admitted he defrauded no less than 3,575 victims of more than $16 million.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Karlsson faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine for the wire fraud and securities fraud charges, and 20 years in prison and a $500,000 maximum fine for the money laundering charge. In addition, the court also may order an additional term of supervised release, fines or other assessments, and restitution, if appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence.</p>\n<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L.

Demers of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday's unsealed indictment expands upon the FBI\u2019s 2018 charges for the unprecedented cyberattacks conducted by the North Korean regime,\u201d said the FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cThe ongoing targeting, compromise, and cyber-enabled theft by North Korea from global victims was met with the outstanding, persistent investigative efforts of the FBI in close collaboration with U.S. and international partners. By arresting facilitators, seizing funds, and charging those responsible for the hacking conspiracy, the FBI continues to impose consequences and hold North Korea accountable for its criminal cyber activity.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running, and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the Central District of California. \u201cThe conduct detailed in the indictment are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract revenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case is a particularly striking example of the growing alliance between officials within some national governments and highly sophisticated cyber-criminals,\u201d said U.S. Secret Service Assistant Director Michael R. D\u2019Ambrosio. \u201cThe individuals indicted today committed a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes: from ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns, to digital bank heists and sophisticated money laundering operations. With victims strewn across the globe, this case shows yet again that the challenge of cybercrime is, and will continue to be, a struggle that can only be won through partnerships, perseverance, and a relentless focus on holding criminals accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hacking indictment filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that Jon Chang Hyok (\uc804\ucc3d\ud601), 31; Kim Il (\uae40\uc77c), 27; and Park Jin Hyok (\ubc15\uc9c4\ud601), 36, were members of units of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which engaged in criminal hacking. These North Korean military hacking units are known by multiple names in the cybersecurity community, including Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). Park was previously charged in a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and\">criminal complaint</a> unsealed in September 2018.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges a broad array of criminal cyber activities undertaken by the conspiracy, in the United States and abroad, for revenge or financial gain. The schemes alleged include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Cyberattacks on the Entertainment Industry</em></strong>: The destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 in retaliation for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a movie that depicted a fictional assassination of the DPRK\u2019s leader; the December 2014 targeting of AMC Theatres, which was scheduled to show the film; and a 2015 intrusion into Mammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Cyber-Enabled Heists from Banks</em></strong>: Attempts from 2015 through 2019 to steal more than $1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, and Africa by hacking the banks\u2019 computer networks and sending fraudulent Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Cyber-Enabled ATM Cash-Out Thefts</em></strong>: Thefts through ATM cash-out schemes \u2013 referred to by the U.S. government as \u201cFASTCash\u201d \u2013 including the October 2018 theft of $6.1 million from BankIslami Pakistan Limited (BankIslami).</li>\n<li><strong><em>Ransomware and Cyber-Enabled Extortion</em></strong>: Creation of the destructive WannaCry 2.0 ransomware in May 2017, and the extortion and attempted extortion of victim companies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive data and deployment of other ransomware.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Creation and Deployment of Malicious Cryptocurrency Applications</em></strong>: Development of multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications from March 2018 through at least September 2020 \u2013 including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale \u2013 which would provide the North Korean hackers a backdoor into the victims\u2019 computers.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Targeting of Cryptocurrency Companies and Theft of Cryptocurrency</em></strong>: Targeting of hundreds of cryptocurrency companies and the theft of tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency, including $75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in December 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in August 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application as a backdoor.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Spear-Phishing Campaigns</em></strong>: Multiple spear-phishing campaigns from March 2016 through February 2020 that targeted employees of United States cleared defense contractors, energy companies, aerospace companies, technology companies, the U.S.Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Marine Chain Token and Initial Coin Offering</em></strong>: Development and marketing in 2017 and 2018 of the Marine Chain Token to enable investors to purchase fractional ownership interests in marine shipping vessels, supported by a blockchain, which would allow the DPRK to secretly obtain funds from investors, control interests in marine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the hacking indictment, which was filed on Dec. 8, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and unsealed today, the three defendants were members of units of the RGB who were at times stationed by the North Korean government in other countries, including China and Russia. While these defendants were part of RGB units that have been referred to by cybersecurity researchers as Lazarus Group and APT38, the indictment alleges that these groups engaged in a single conspiracy to cause damage, steal data and money, and otherwise further the strategic and financial interests of the DPRK government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Money Launderer Charged in California and Georgia</em></strong></p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean conspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes. Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p>With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators\u2019 activities, Alaumary organized teams of co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018. Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka \u201cRay Hushpuppi,\u201d and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars\">charged Abbas in a separate case</a> alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Accompanying Mitigation Efforts</em></strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department provided specific information to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the hackers with the goals of remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of information took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance of foreign law enforcement partners. The FBI also collaborated with certain private cybersecurity companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion TTPs used by the members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the criminal charges, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Treasury, today released a joint cybersecurity advisory and malware analysis reports (MARs) regarding North Korean cryptocurrency malware. The joint cybersecurity analysis and MARs highlight the cyber threat North Korea \u2013 which is referred to by the U.S. government as HIDDEN COBRA \u2013 poses to cryptocurrency and identify malware and indicators of compromise related to the \u201cAppleJeus\u201d family of malware (the name given by the cybersecurity community to a family of North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications that includes Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale). The joint cybersecurity advisory and MARs collectively provide the cybersecurity community and public with information about identifying North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications, avoiding intrusions, and remedying infections.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FBI also obtained seizure warrants authorizing the FBI to seize cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean hackers from a victim in the indictment \u2013 a financial services company in New York \u2013 held at two cryptocurrency exchanges. The seizures include sums of multiple cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million, which will ultimately be returned to the victim.</p>\n<p>Jon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p>In relation to the case filed in Los Angeles, Alaumary has agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>The investigation of Jon, Kim, and Park was led by the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office, which worked closely with the FBI\u2019s Charlotte Field Office. The U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office and Global Investigative Operations Center provided substantial assistance. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division also provided substantial assistance.</p>\n<p>The investigations of Alaumary were conducted by the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Savannah Field Office, FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office, and the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office and Global Investigative Operations Center. The FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division also provided substantial assistance.</p>\n<p>The case against Jon, Kim, and Park is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anil J. Antony and Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, with substantial assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki are also prosecuting the case against Alaumary, in which the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) provided substantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki, along with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan of the Asset Forfeiture Section, also obtained the seizure warrants for cryptocurrency stolen from the financial services company in New York.</p>\n<p>The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout these investigations, as did many of the FBI\u2019s Legal Attach\u00e9s, as well as foreign authorities around the world. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Today, the Justice Department is announcing charges following a significant national security cyber investigation first disclosed publicly more than two years ago.</p>\n<p>As laid out in today\u2019s indictment, North Korea\u2019s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world\u2019s leading bank robbers. The Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same. We were together back in September 2018, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, with the assistance of the National Security Division, charged a North Korean programmer, who was working for the government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), with conspiring to conduct some of the most damaging cyberattacks ever, including the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>November 2014 destructive attack and hack-and-dump targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment over a comedy film they did not like;</li>\n<li>February 2016 cyber-enabled heist of $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh and other heists; and</li>\n<li>May 2017 global Wannacry 2.0 attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The events as described in that complaint provided the first indications that the North Korean regime would become focused on, and adept at, stealing money from institutions around the world.</p>\n<p>Today, the Department unseals an indictment, returned by a grand jury in the Central District of California, charging the same DPRK programmer, as well as two newly-identified DPRK conspirators, with a campaign of cyber heists and extortion schemes, targeting both traditional and cryptocurrencies. The indictment adds to the list of victims since 2018, including continued cyber-enabled heists from banks on four continents targeting over $1.2 billion. It also describes in stark detail how the DPRK cyber threat has followed the money and turned its revenue generation sights on the most cutting edge aspects of international finance, including through the theft of cryptocurrency from exchanges and other financial institutions, in some cases through the creation and deployment of cryptocurrency applications with hidden backdoors. The indictment refines the attribution of this crime spree to the DPRK military intelligence services, specifically the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Simply put, the regime has become a criminal syndicate with a flag, which harnesses its state resources to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>In a moment, you will hear more details about the charges and evidence in this case from the Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California, the FBI, and the United States Secret Service. But, I want to take a moment to highlight the significance of these charges for the Department, the United States, and the international community: As the description of victim entities in the indictment shows, the DPRK\u2019s malicious activities are a global problem, requiring global awareness, condemnation, and cooperative disruption. With this indictment and related disruptions, the United States continues to do its part.</p>\n<p>First, we\u00a0 continue to shine a light on the global campaign of criminality being waged by the DPRK. Nation-state indictments like this are an important step in identifying the problem, calling it out in a legally rigorous format, and building international consensus.</p>\n<p>Second, in addition to educating the U.S. public and international community about this activity, we are also targeting the networks through which the DPRK is cashing-out its ill-gotten gains. As will be described in more detail by my colleagues, the Department has obtained custody over a dual-U.S./Canadian national who organized the laundering of millions of dollars stolen by the DPRK hackers. He has admitted his role in these criminal schemes in a plea agreement, and he will be held to account for his conduct. This prosecution demonstrates the commitment of the Department to ensuring that those who conspire with the DPRK hackers will face justice. The Department was also able to seize and expects to ultimately return almost $2 million stolen by the DPRK hackers from a New York-based financial services company. This follows on similar seizure actions announced in March and August 2020, in which with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia seized and froze approximately $8.5 million of cryptocurrency. These cryptocurrency seizures and prosecution of a high-level money launderer collectively represent important steps in disrupting the DPRK hackers and their money laundering networks, and illustrate the Department\u2019s commitment to repatriating stolen funds before they reach the DPRK.</p>\n<p>Third, the United States is empowering network defenders. As you will hear about, the prosecutors and investigators have \u2014 throughout this investigation \u2014 worked closely with victims and intended victims of the DPRK hackers, and have provided these victims with information about avoiding and remediating infections. This work continues today. Accompanying this announcement, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, with the assistance of the Department of the Treasury, are releasing a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory and Malware Analysis Report regarding the DPRK\u2019s malicious cryptocurrency applications. The criminal investigation leading to today\u2019s indictment obtained that information for distribution to network defenders. Further, the context provided in today\u2019s indictment underscores the necessity of paying attention to this Advisory and its recommendation.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the allegations in today\u2019s indictment inform and empower the international community so that they can not only join us in condemning this activity, but also help stop it. In that regard, the European Union\u2019s (EU) July 2020 sanctions related to the Lazarus group was a welcome development. We commend the EU for its initial efforts to impose consequences for state-sponsored malicious cyber activities. However, other nations that wish to be regarded as responsible actors on the international stage must also step up. These conspirators described in today\u2019s indictment are alleged to have been working, at times, from locations in China and Russia. The DPRK has also utilized Chinese over-the-counter cryptocurrency traders and other criminal networks to launder the funds. Just as the United States has disrupted the DPRK\u2019s crime spree through arrests, forfeitures, and seizures, the time is ripe for Russia and China, as well as any other country whose entities or nationals play a role in the DPRK revenue-generation efforts, to take action.</p>\n<p>The Department\u2019s criminal charges are uniquely credible forms of attribution \u2014 we can prove these allegations beyond a reasonable doubt using only unclassified, admissible evidence. And they are the only way in which the Department speaks. If the choice here is between remaining silent while we at the Department watch nations engage in malicious, norms-violating cyber activity, or charges these cases, the choice is obvious \u2014 we will charge them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before I turn this over, I\u2019d like to thank the agents at the FBI in Los Angeles, Charlotte, and Raleigh; the Secret Service in Savannah, Los Angeles, and D.C.; and the prosecutors in Los Angeles and at the National Security Division in D.C. for stepping up to the plate to play their part.</p></div>",

I can assure everyone that the FBI and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat these cyber threats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCybercriminals are constantly exploring new possibilities to abuse technology and financial frameworks to victimize millions of users in a moment from anywhere in the world,\u201d said Fernando Ruiz, Head of Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s operation shows how through a proper law enforcement international coordination we can turn the table on these criminals and bring them to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that the QQAAZZ network laundered, or attempted to launder, tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stolen funds from victims of cybercrimes since 2016.</p>\n<p>Comprised of several layers of members from Latvia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Belgium, among other countries, the QQAAZZ network opened and maintained hundreds of corporate and personal bank accounts at financial institutions throughout the world to receive money from cybercriminals who stole it from bank accounts of victims.\u00a0 The funds were then transferred to other QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts and sometimes converted to cryptocurrency using \u201ctumbling\u201d services designed to hide the original source of the funds.\u00a0 After taking a fee of up to 40 to 50 percent, QQAAZZ returned the balance of the stolen funds to their cybercriminal clientele.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The QQAAZZ members secured these bank accounts by using both legitimate and fraudulent Polish and Bulgarian identification documents to create and register dozens of shell companies which conducted no legitimate business activity. Using these registration documents, the QQAAZZ members then opened corporate bank accounts in the names of the shell companies at numerous financial institutions around the world, thereby generating hundreds of QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts available to receive stolen funds from cyber thieves.</p>\n<p>QQAAZZ advertised its services as a \u201cglobal, complicit bank drops service\u201d on Russian-speaking online cybercriminal forums where cybercriminals gather to offer or seek specialized skills or services needed to engage in a variety of cybercriminal activities. The criminal gangs behind some of the world\u2019s most harmful malware families (<i>e.g.</i>: Dridex, Trickbot, GozNym, etc.) are among those cybercriminal groups that benefited from the services provided by QQAAZZ.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The 14 defendants named in the indictment unsealed today are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nika Nazarovi, aka \u201cNika Utiashvili,\u201d aka \u201cMihail Atansov,\u201d aka \u201cStefan Trifonov Zhelyazkov,\u201d 32, of Georgia;</li>\n<li>Martins Ignatjevs, aka \u201cYordan Angelov Stoyanov,\u201d aka \u201cAleksander Tihomirov,\u201d aka \u201cSvetlin Iliyanov Asenov,\u201d 33, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Aleksandre Kobiashvili, aka \u201cAntonios Nastas,\u201d aka \u201cOgnyan Krasimirov Trifonov,\u201d 32, of Georgia;</li>\n<li>Dmitrijs Kuzminovs, aka \u201cParush Gospodinov Genchev,\u201d 35, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Valentins Sevecs, aka \u201cMarek Jaswilko,\u201d aka \u201cRafal Szczytko,\u201d 32, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Dmitrijs Slapins, 35, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Armens Vecels, 24, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Artiom Capacli, 31, of Bulgaria;</li>\n<li>Ion Cebanu, 26, of Romania;</li>\n<li>Tomass Trescinkas, 25, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Ruslans Sarapovs, 19, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Silvestrs Tamenieks, 21, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Abdelhak Hamdaoui, 48, of Belgium; and</li>\n<li>Petar Iliev, 37, of Bulgaria.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The five defendants charged in the indictment unsealed in October 2019 are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aleksejs Trofimovics, aka \u201cAleksejs Trofimovich,\u201d aka \u201cAlexey Trofimovich,\u201d aka \u201cAleko Stoyanov Angelov,\u201d 24, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Ruslans Nikitenko, aka \u201cKrzysztof Wojciech Lewko,\u201d aka \u201cMilen Nikolchev Nikolov,\u201d aka \u201cRafal Zimnoch,\u201d 41, of Latvia;\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<li>Arturs Zaharevics, aka \u201cPiotr Ginelli,\u201d aka \u201cArkadiusz Szuberski,\u201d 33, of Latvia;</li>\n<li>Deniss Ruseckis, aka \u201cDenis Rusetsky,\u201d aka \u201cSevdelin Sevdalinov Atanasov,\u201d 24, of Latvia; and</li>\n<li>Deinis Gorenko, 25, of Latvia. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Russian national charged by criminal complaint and arrested in late March 2020 while visiting the United States is Maksim Boiko, aka \u201cMaxim Boyko\u201d aka \u201cgangass,\u201d 30, of Russia.</p>\n<p>The U.S. victims who had funds stolen, or attempted to be stolen, from their online bank accounts (including from banks headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and destined for QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts overseas include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a technology company in Windsor, Connecticut;</li>\n<li>a Jewish Orthodox Synagogue in Brooklyn, New York;</li>\n<li>a medical device manufacturer in York, Pennsylvania;</li>\n<li>an individual in Montclair, New Jersey;</li>\n<li>an architecture firm in Miami, Florida;</li>\n<li>an individual in Acworth, Georgia;</li>\n<li>an automotive parts manufacturer in Livonia, Michigan;</li>\n<li>a homebuilder in Skokie, Illinois;</li>\n<li>an individual in Carrollton, Texas; and</li>\n<li>an individual in Villa Park, California.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Rabbitt and U.S. Attorney Brady praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh Field Office and their law enforcement partners from Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Latvia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Italy, Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic, Australia, Sweden, Austria, Germany and Belgium.\u00a0 Acting Assistant Attorney General Rabbitt and U.S. Attorney Brady also thanked Europol in The Hague, Netherlands for coordinating the investigative efforts of the law enforcement agencies from the 15 participating countries.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs of the Department\u2019s Criminal Division provided significant assistance by coordinating requests to foreign countries for searches, arrests, extraditions and evidence sharing.\u00a0 Assistance was also provided by the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) in Pittsburgh. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles A. \u201cTod\u201d Eberle, Chief of the National Security and Cybercrime Section for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Czarnecki of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and Trial Attorney Michael Parker of the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division.</p>\n<p>An indictment is an accusation.

Rabbitt of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThese arrests show that the department will hold accountable hackers who seek to commandeer and exploit the intellectual property of American companies for financial gain, no matter where they may be located.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants lined their pockets by stealing and selling the work of other video-game developers \u2013 even going so far as to make customers pay a licensing fee to play stolen games,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Brian Moran for the Western District of Washington.\u00a0 \u201cThis conduct doesn\u2019t just harm billion dollar companies, it hijacks the hard work of individuals working to advance in the video-game industry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTheft of intellectual property hurts U.S. industry, game developers and exploits legitimate gaming customers, all of which threaten the legitimacy of the commercial video game industry,\u201d said Acting\u00a0Special Agent in Charge Eben Roberts of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Seattle. \u00a0\u201cWe are committed to working with our international partners to find criminals like these who steal copyrighted material and bring cyber criminals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine if something you invented was stolen from you and then marketed and sold to customers around the world. That is exactly what Team Xecuter was doing,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a perfect example of why the FBI has made the prevention of the theft of intellectual property a priority. These arrests should send a message to would-be pirates that the FBI does not consider these crimes to be a game.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the Team Xecuter criminal enterprise is comprised of over a dozen individual members located around the world.\u00a0 These members include developers who exploit vulnerabilities in videogame consoles and design circumvention devices; website designers who create the various websites that promote the enterprise\u2019s devices; suppliers who manufacture the devices; and resellers around the world who sell and distribute the devices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that due to the illegal nature of its business, Team Xecuter continuously sought to evade enforcement efforts by victim companies, financial institutions, and law enforcement.\u00a0 Notably, Team Xecuter attempted to protect its overall business by using a wide variety of brands, websites, and distribution channels, according to the indictment.\u00a0 From approximately June 2013 through August 2020, Team Xecuter used a variety of product names for its devices, such as the Gateway 3DS, the Stargate, the TrueBlue Mini, the Classic2Magic, and the SX line of devices that included the SX OS, the SX Pro, the SX Lite, and the SX Core.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Team Xecuter at times cloaked its illegal activity with a purported desire to support gaming enthusiasts who wanted to design their own videogames for noncommercial use. \u00a0However, the overwhelming demand and use for the enterprise\u2019s devices was to play pirated videogames.\u00a0 To support this illegal activity, Team Xecuter allegedly helped create and support online libraries of pirated videogames for its customers, and several of the enterprise\u2019s devices came preloaded with numerous pirated videogames.\u00a0 According to the indictment, Team Xecuter was so brazen that it even required customers to purchase a \u201clicense\u201d to unlock the full features of its custom firmware, the SX OS, in order to enable the ability to play pirated videogames.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In September 2020, Louarn and Bowser were arrested abroad in connection with the charges in this case.\u00a0 The United States will seek Louarn\u2019s extradition to stand trial in the United States.\u00a0 Bowser was arrested and deported from the Dominican Republic, and appeared today in federal court, in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Each defendant is charged with 11 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to circumvent technological measures and to traffic in circumvention devices, trafficking in circumvention devices, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>This case is being investigated jointly by the FBI and HSI.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by Senior Counsel Frank Lin of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section Assistant U.S. Attorneys Francis Franze-Nakamura and Brian Werner of the Western District of Washington, with significant and ongoing assistance from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs. \u00a0The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by its foreign government counterparts and the Government of the Dominican Republic, and Interpol Dominicana.</p>\n<p>The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 Learn more about the history of our agency at\u00a0<a href=\"https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=cd8ee1d3-91e200d1-cd89c536-ac1f6b01767e-fa06971d1f6406f5&amp;q=1&amp;e=1e106996-ef48-4a3a-b5ce-1dd5c502f962&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDcsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA5MjIuMjc1MjEwMzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qdXN0aWNlLmdvdi9DZWxlYnJhdGluZzE1MFllYXJzP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSJ9.56ZI-UjMLHYCLqPg2Tc3JxqHD8uGPNYxGLhLa2S4ncg%2Fs%2F763121421%2Fbr%2F85750354426-l\">www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years</a>.</p></div>",

The operation, which was conducted across the United States and Europe, demonstrates the continued partnership between JCODE and Europol against the illegal sale of drugs and other illicit goods and services.\u00a0 Operation DisrupTor builds on the success of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/j-code-announces-61-arrests-in-its-second-coordinated-law-enforcement-operation-targeting-opioid-trafficking-on-the-darknet\">Operation SaboTor</a> and the coordinated law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-germans-who-allegedly-operated-dark-web-marketplace-over-1-million-users-face-us\">takedown of the Wall Street Market</a>, one of the largest illegal online markets on the dark web.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Following the Wall Street Market takedown in May 2019, U.S. and international law enforcement agencies obtained intelligence to identify Darknet drug traffickers, resulting in a series of complementary, but separate, law enforcement investigations. Operation DisrupTor actions have resulted in the arrest of 179 Darknet drug traffickers and fraudulent criminals who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across the United States and Europe.</p>\n<p>This operation resulted in the seizure of over $6.5 million in both cash and virtual currencies; approximately 500 kilograms of drugs worldwide; 274 kilograms of drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, and medicine containing addictive substances in the United States; and 63 firearms. Darknet vendor accounts were identified and attributed to real individuals selling illicit goods on Darknet market sites such as AlphaBay, Dream, WallStreet, Nightmare, Empire, White House, DeepSea, Dark Market and others. By leveraging complementary partnerships and surging resources across the U.S. government and Europol, Operation DisrupTor was used to significantly disrupt the online opioid trade and send a strong message that criminals operating on the Darknet are not beyond the reach of law enforcement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Operation DisrupTor led to 121 arrests in the United States including two in Canada at the request of the United States, 42 in Germany, eight in the Netherlands, four in the United Kingdom, three in Austria, and one in Sweden. A number of investigations are still ongoing to identify the individuals behind dark web accounts.</p>\n<p>\u201cCriminals selling fentanyl on the Darknet should pay attention to Operation DisrupTor,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.\u00a0 \u201cThe arrest of 179 of them in seven countries\u2014with the seizure of their drug supplies and their money as well\u2014shows that there will be no safe haven for drug dealing in cyberspace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the spike in opioid-related overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that today\u2019s announcement is important and timely,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI wants to assure the American public, and the world, that we are committed to identifying Darknet drug dealers and bringing them to justice.\u00a0 But our\u00a0work does not end with today\u2019s announcement. The FBI, through JCODE and our partnership with Europol, continues to be actively engaged in a combined effort to disrupt the borderless, worldwide trade of illicit drugs.\u00a0The FBI will continue to use all investigative techniques and tools to identify and prosecute Darknet opioid dealers, wherever they may be located.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe 21st century has ushered in a tidal wave of technological advances that have changed the way we live,\u201d said DEA Acting Administrator Timothy J. Shea.\u00a0 \u201cBut as technology has evolved, so too have the tactics of drug traffickers.\u00a0 Riding the wave of technological advances, criminals attempt to further hide their activities within the dark web through virtual private networks and tails, presenting new challenges to law enforcement in the enduring battle against illegal drugs.\u00a0 Operation DisrupTor demonstrates the ability of DEA and our partners to outpace these digital criminals in this ever-changing domain, by implementing innovative ways to identify traffickers attempting to operate anonymously and disrupt these criminal enterprises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cU.S. Immigration and Custom\u2019s Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has played an integral role in Operation DisrupTor which has effectively removed opioids from our communities,\u201d said ICE Acting Deputy Director Derek Benner.\u00a0 \u201cIt has been an honor to work alongside our domestic and international law enforcement partners and pursue bad actors hiding on the Darknet.\u00a0 Our trained cyber analysts and investigators have conducted undercover efforts that target dark website operators, vendors and prolific buyers of these dangerous drugs. HSI special agents employ unique investigative capabilities to trace and identify the proceeds stemming from the distribution and online sales of fentanyl and other illicit opioids. These efforts will continue to thwart a significant amount of criminal drug sale activity and deter criminals believing they can operate with anonymity on the Darknet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has worked diligently for years to rid the mail of illicit drug trafficking and preserve the integrity of the mail,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale.\u00a0 \u201cMost importantly, these efforts provide a safe environment for postal employees and the American public.\u00a0 Today\u2019s announcement serves as an outstanding example of the worldwide impact Postal Inspectors can make through our ever-growing partnerships with federal and international law enforcement agencies.\u00a0 On behalf of the U.S. Postal Service, we offer our sincere appreciation to all of our partners in this operation who helped protect the nation\u2019s mail, and we pledge to never relent in our pursuit of criminals seeking to exploit the U.S. mail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaw enforcement is most effective when working together, and today\u2019s announcement sends a strong message to criminals selling or buying illicit goods on the dark web: the hidden internet is no longer hidden, and your anonymous activity is not anonymous,\u201d said Edvardas \u0160ileris, the Head of Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). \u201cLaw enforcement is committed to tracking down criminals, no matter where they operate \u2013 be it on the streets or behind a computer screen.\u201d</p>\n<p>The extensive operation, which lasted nine months, resulted in over dozens of federal prosecutions including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Los Angeles JCODE Task Force, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, successfully dismantled a drug trafficking organization that used online monikers such as \u201cStealthgod\u201d to sell methamphetamine and MDMA on multiple Darknet marketplaces. Investigators have linked the crew to more than 18,000 illicit drug sales to customers in at least 35 states and numerous countries around the world. During law enforcement actions in Southern California earlier this year, members of JCODE arrested five defendants and seized approximately 120 pounds of methamphetamine, seven kilograms of MDMA and five firearms. Two of the five \u2013 Teresa McGrath, 34, of Sunland-Tujunga, and Mark Chavez, 41, of downtown Los Angeles \u2013 have since pleaded guilty to narcotics-trafficking and other offenses, and each faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. As the investigation continued, the Los Angeles JCODE Task Force made additional seizures, including $1.6 million in cryptocurrency, 11 pounds of methamphetamine and 14 pounds of pills pressed with methamphetamine. Andres Bermudez, 37, of Palmdale, California, who allegedly was a main supplier of methamphetamine to the \u201cStealthgod\u201d crew, was charged last week with a narcotics-trafficking offense that carry a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. He is considered a fugitive.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>Arden McCann, 32, of Quebec, Canada, was charged with conspiring to import drugs into the United States and money laundering conspiracy, in a four-count indictment returned by a grand jury in Atlanta, Georgia. According to court documents, the defendant is alleged to have imported alprazolam, fentanyl, U-47700, and fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil, furanyl fentanyl, 4-fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl, acryl fentanyl, and methoxyacetyl fentanyl into the United States from Canada and China. The superseding indictment alleges that fentanyl analogues the defendant imported into the United States resulted in a non-fatal overdose in April 2016, and fentanyl the defendant imported into the United States resulted in an overdose death in December 2016.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>Khlari Sirotkin, 36, of Colorado; Kelly Stephens, 32, of Colorado; Sean Deaver, 36, of Nevada; Abby Jones, 37, of Nevada; and Sasha Sirotkin, 32, of California, were charged with drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy, in a 21-count indictment returned by a grand jury in Cincinnati, Ohio. According to court documents, the defendants are alleged to be members of one of the most prolific online drug trafficking organizations in the United States and allegedly specialized in the manufacturing and distribution of more than one million fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills and laundered approximately $2.8 million over the course of the conspiracy. The pressed fentanyl pills, along with heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine, were shipped to the Southern District of Ohio and throughout the country.\u00a0FBI, DEA, FDA, HSI and USPIS agents seized 2.5 kilograms of fentanyl; 5,095 pressed xanax; 50 suboxone; 16.5 grams of cocaine; 37 grams of crystal meth; 12 grams of black tar heroin; an industrial pill press; 5,908 pounds of dried marijuana with an estimated street value of $9 million; $80,191 in cash, 10 firearms and one pound of fentanyl.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>The FBI Washington Field Office\u2019s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, successfully thwarted a firebomb attack plot involving explosives, firearms, the Darknet, prescription opioid trafficking, cryptocurrency, and sophisticated money laundering. William Anderson Burgamy, 33, of Hanover, Maryland, and Hyrum T. Wilson, 41, of Auburn, Nebraska, pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of Virginia to charges related to a conspiracy to use explosives to firebomb and destroy a competitor pharmacy in Nebraska. Burgamy, who is not a pharmacist, operated as the Darknet vendor NeverPressedRX (NPRX) since at least August 2019. Wilson, who was a licensed pharmacist, illegally mailed to Burgamy over 19,000 dosage units of prescription medications, including opioids, from his pharmacy in Nebraska. Burgamy illegally sold prescription drugs through his Darknet vendor account to customers nationwide, and claimed at one point that he made nearly $1 million total. Burgamy and Wilson agreed that Burgamy and another individual would carry multiple firearms during the attack operation and use explosives, specifically Molotov cocktails enhanced with Styrofoam as a thickening agent, to burn the victim pharmacy down in furtherance of their drug trafficking scheme. Law enforcement agents seized thousands of opioid pills, eight unsecured firearms, including two loaded AR-15 assault rifles with high capacity magazines, and over $19,000 cash. Prior to Burgamy\u2019s arrest in April 2020, which uncovered and thwarted the firebombing plot, Burgamy and Wilson fully intended on the attack occurring after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>Aaron Brewer, 39, of Corsicana, Texas, was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance and distribution of a controlled substance in a two-count indictment returned by a grand jury in the Northern District of Texas. According to court documents, the defendant allegedly sold cocaine, heroin, and other drugs via the dark web. He allegedly accepted payment in cryptocurrency, primarily bitcoin, and then shipped the drugs to customers\u2019 addresses through the U.S. mail and other shipping services. \u00a0Following Mr. Brewer\u2019s arrest on July 2, agents with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and FBI Dallas Field Office seized roughly 650 grams of black tar heroin, cocaine, and OxyContin, two computers, and more than $870 in postage stamps, as well as a ledger outlining 757 drug shipments sent to 609 unique addresses between December 2019 and March 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An indictment and criminal complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Operation DisrupTor was a collaborative initiative across JCODE members, including the Department of Justice; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and Department of Defense (DOD). Local, state and other federal agencies also contributed to Operation DisrupTor investigations.\u00a0 The investigations leading to Operation DisrupTor were significantly aided by essential support and coordination by the Department of Justice\u2019s multi-agency Special Operations Division, the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and Organized Crime and Gang Section, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the National Cyber Joint Investigative Task Force (NCJITF), Europol and its Dark Web team and international partners Eurojust, Austrian Federal Investigation Bureau (Bundeskriminalamt), Cyprus Police (\u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5), German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), Canada\u2019s Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Portuguese Judicial Police (Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria), Dutch Police (Politie), Swedish Police (Polisen), the British National Crime Agency, Australia's Western Australia Police Force and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.</p>\n<p>Federal prosecutions are being conducted in more than 20 Federal districts, including: the Central District of California, the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, the Southern District of California, the District of Colorado, the District of Columbia, the District of Connecticut, the Middle District of Florida, the Southern District of Florida, the Northern District of Georgia, the District of Hawaii, the Western District of Missouri, the District of New Jersey, the Western District of North Carolina, the Northern District of Ohio, the Southern District of Ohio, District of Oregon, the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District of Virginia, the District of the Virgin Islands and the Western District of Washington.</p>\n<p>JCODE is an FBI-led Department of Justice initiative, which works closely with the DEA-led, multi-agency, Special Operations Division to support, coordinate and de-conflict investigations targeting for disruption and dismantlement of the\u00a0online sale of illegal drugs, especially fentanyl and other opioids.

Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis case highlights the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 efforts to infiltrate the networks of American companies in search of valuable commercial information and intellectual property.\u00a0 It is yet another effort by a rogue foreign nation to steal the fruits of this country\u2019s hard work and expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will relentlessly pursue and expose those who seek to harm American companies and individuals wherever they reside in the world,\u201d said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cThe use of malware, the theft of commercial data and intellectual property, and the use of social engineering to steal the identities of U.S. citizens to accomplish unlawful acts will not be tolerated. Along with our incredible and steadfast law enforcement partners, the Eastern District of Virginia continues to lead efforts to combat serious cybercrime globally and the charges outlined in the indictment exposing IRGC linked hacking operations in the United States are just another example of the fruits of our seamless teamwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s charges are yet another example of the FBI\u2019s dedication to investigating those who target and attempt to steal data and proprietary information from the U.S.,\u201d said James A.

The defendants targeted thousands of individuals in an attempt to steal critical information related to U.S. aerospace and satellite technology. The FBI remains dedicated to protecting the U.S., and we continue to impose risk and consequences on cyber adversaries through our unique authorities, world-class capabilities, and enduring partnerships.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, the defendants\u2019 hacking campaign, which targeted numerous companies and organizations in the United States and abroad, began in approximately July 2015 and continued until at least February 2019.\u00a0 According to the indictment, the defendants at one time possessed a target list of over 1,800 online accounts, including accounts belonging to organizations and companies involved in aerospace or satellite technology and international government organizations in Australia, Israel, Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>To facilitate their victimization of these targets, the defendants engaged in a coordinated campaign of social engineering to identify real U.S. citizens working in the satellite and aerospace fields whose identities the defendants could assume online.\u00a0 The defendants then impersonated those individuals and used their stolen identities to register email addresses and fraudulently purchase domains and hacking tools for use in the scheme.\u00a0 The defendants then created customized spear phishing emails that purported to be from the individuals whose identities the defendants had stolen, in an attempt to entice the recipients to click on malicious links embedded in the emails.\u00a0 Once a recipient clicked on a malicious link, malware would be downloaded to the individual\u2019s computer, giving the defendants unauthorized access to the recipient\u2019s computer and network.\u00a0 The defendants then used additional hacking tools to maintain unauthorized access, escalate their privileges, and steal data sought by the IRGC.\u00a0 Using these methods, the defendants successfully compromised multiple victim networks, resulting in the theft of sensitive commercial information, intellectual property, and personal data from victim companies, including a satellite-tracking company and a satellite voice and data communication company.</p>\n<p>Charged in the indictment are defendants Said Pourkarim Arabi, 34, Mohammad Reza Espargham, age unknown, and Mohammad Bayati, 34.\u00a0 The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has issued warrants for their arrest.</p>\n<p>Arabi, who was a member of the IRGC, is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, obtaining information by unauthorized access to protected computers, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, intentional damage to protected computers, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Esphargham is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, obtaining information by unauthorized access to protected computers, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, intentional damage to protected computers, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bayati is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. \u00a0A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathaniel Smith III, Jay V.

Demers.\u00a0 \u201cWhether directing such hacking activities, or by offering a safe haven for Iranian criminal hackers, Iran is complicit in the targeting of innocent victims worldwide and is deepening its status as a rogue state. \u00a0By contrast, the Department of Justice and its U.S. government partners stand with such victims, regardless of their location, and we will continue our cooperative efforts domestically and internationally to disrupt Iranian hacking activities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is using its unique partnerships and world-class capabilities to hold Iranian cyber actors publicly accountable for their actions,\u201d\u00a0said Executive Assistant Director Terry Wade of the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. \u201cThose malicious activities, as once again outlined this week, highlight Iran\u2019s persistent use of cyber methods to harm the citizens of the United States and its allies. No cyber actor should think they can compromise U.S. networks, steal our intellectual property, or hold our critical infrastructure at risk without incurring risk themselves. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to protect U.S. interests and to impose consequences on those cyber actors working on behalf of the Government of Iran in furtherance of their nefarious goals.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Sept. 14, 2020, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency jointly published a Cybersecurity Advisory regarding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an Iran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several U.S. federal agencies and other U.S.-based networks.</p>\n<p>On Sept.\u00a015, 2020, in the District of Massachusetts, the Department announced the unsealing of a three-count indictment charging two hackers in relation to their intrusions into, and defacements of, websites hosted in the United States. \u00a0The hackers, Behzad Mohammadzadeh, aka \u201cMrb3hz4d,\u201d a citizen and resident of the Iran, and Marwan Abusrour, aka \u201cMrwn007,\u201d a stateless national under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, conspired to and subsequently damaged computers in perceived retaliation for the January 2, 2020 U.S. military strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.\u00a0 These defacements were a subset of the over 1,400 defacements around the world for which the defendants claimed responsibility between in or around June 2016 and July 2020.</p>\n<p>On Sept.\u00a016, 2020, in the District of New Jersey, the Department announced the unsealing of a 10-count indictment charging two hackers, who sometimes operated under the using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal,\u201d in relation to coordinated cyber intrusions and hacking campaigns targeted computer systems in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.\u00a0 The defendants, Hooman Heidarian, aka \u201cneo,\u201d and Medhi Farhadi, aka \u201cMehdi Mahdavi,\u201d both Iranian nationals residing in Iran, stole hundreds of terabytes of data, which typically included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research.\u00a0 In some instances, the defendants\u2019 hacks were politically motivated or at the behest of the government of Iran, including instances where they obtained information regarding dissidents, human rights activists, and opposition leaders.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants sold the hacked data and information on the black market for private financial gain.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 17, 2020, in the Eastern District of Virginia, the Department announced the unsealing of a nine-count indictment charging three hackers in relation to an approximately four-year campaign to steal and attempt to steal critical information related to aerospace and satellite technology and resources, including sensitive commercial information, intellectual property, and personal data.\u00a0 The defendants, Said Pourkarim Arabi, Mohammad Reza Espargham, and Mohammad Bayati, all Iranian nationals residing in Iran, conducted their activity at the direction of the IRGC, of which Arabi was a member.\u00a0 The defendants primarily accomplished their intrusions through socially engineered spearphishing campaigns, using at least one target list of over 1,800 individuals in Australia, Israel, Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 Upon successfully enticing a victim to click on a link in such a spearphishing e-mail, a member of the conspiracy would deploy malware that allowed the conspirators to gain access credentials, escalate their privileges, maintain their unauthorized access to victim networks, and ultimately steal the sought-after data.\u00a0 To accompany the unsealing of this indictment, and to aid potential targets in the identification of malicious activity, the FBI released a Private Industry Notification (PIN) that identified the conspiracy\u2019s TTPs and indicators of compromise.</p>\n<p>Also on Sept.\u00a017, 2020, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against 45 individuals and one front company associated with the MOIS who comprised the cyber threat group known publicly as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threat 39\u201d (APT39), \u201cChafer,\u201d \u201cRemexi,\u201d \u201cCadelspy,\u201d or \u201cITG07.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 According to OFAC, masked behind its front company, Rana Intelligence Computing Company (Rana), the MOIS employed a years-long malware campaign that targeted Iran\u2019s own citizens, the government networks of Iran\u2019s neighboring countries, and U.S.-based travel services companies. Concurrent with OFAC\u2019s action, and following a long-term FBI investigation, the FBI released technical indicators about Rana\u2019s malware in an FBI FLASH alert.\u00a0 This alert provides information to assist organizations and individuals in determining whether they were targeted by Rana.</p>\n<p>The above disruptive actions targeting Iranian malicious cyber activities were the result of investigations conducted by the FBI\u2019s Boston, Newark, and Washington Field Offices and Cyber Division, the United States Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Eastern District of Virginia, District of Massachusetts, and District of New Jersey, and the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\u00a0 Several of the disruptive actions were the result of the close partnership between these Department of Justice components and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of the Treasury\u2019s OFAC, and coordination through the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force.</p>\n<p>The details contained in the above-described charging document are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

Rosen.\u00a0 \u201cRegrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making China safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the department\u2019s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state cyber activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it is also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilize every tool we have to administer justice,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cThe arrests in Malaysia are a direct result of partnership, cooperation and collaboration. As the cyber threat continues to evolve larger than any one agency can address, the FBI remains committed to being an indispensable partner to our\u00a0federal, international and private sector partners to stop rampant\u00a0cyber crime\u00a0and\u00a0hold those carrying out these kind of actions accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented. The alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and steal information from victims worldwide,\u201d said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.\u00a0 \u201cAs set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal across the globe.\u00a0 This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal component \u2013 the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game companies and launder illicit proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe actions announced today reflect a years-long commitment by the FBI Washington Field Office to pursue the perpetrators of the computer intrusion campaigns described in the indictments, and to bring those perpetrators to justice,\u201d said Acting Assistant Director in Charge James A. Dawson, FBI Washington Field Office. \u201cThis case demonstrates the FBI\u2019s dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter where they are, and to whom they may be connected.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran (\u5f20\u6d69\u7136), 35, and Tan Dailin (\u8c2d\u6234\u6797), 35, with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\u201cCFAA\u201d).\u00a0 The indictment charged Zhang and Tan with participating in a \u201cComputer Hacking Conspiracy,\u201d which targeted high-technology and similar organizations.\u00a0 The indictment also charged that, as an additional way to make money, Zhang and Tan participated in a \u201cVideo Game Conspiracy,\u201d through which Zhang and Tan, together with others, sought to make money by hacking video game companies, obtaining and otherwise generating digital items of value (e.g., video game currency), and then selling such items for profit.\u00a0 In several instances, they used their unauthorized access to gaming company networks take action against other unrelated groups engaged in the same fraudulent generation of gaming artifacts, thereby attempting to eliminate the criminal competition.</p>\n<p>One of the August 2020, indictments charged Jiang Lizhi (\u848b\u7acb\u5fd7), 35, Qian Chuan (\u94b1\u5ddd), 39, and Fu Qiang (\u4ed8\u5f3a), 37, with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.\u00a0 The racketeering conspiracy pertained to the three defendants\u2019 conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (\u201cChengdu 404\u201d), a PRC company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses affecting over 100 victim companies, organizations, and individuals in the United States and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \u00a0The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam, and targeted, but did not compromise, government computer networks in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 In one notable instance, the defendants conducted a ransomware attack on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to combating global poverty.</p>\n<p>The defendants associated with Chengdu 404 employed sophisticated hacking techniques to gain and maintain access to victim computer networks.\u00a0 One example was the defendants\u2019 use of \u201csupply chain attacks,\u201d in which the hackers compromised software providers and then modified the providers\u2019 code to facilitate further intrusions against the software providers\u2019 customers.\u00a0 Another example was the hackers\u2019 use of C2 \u201cdead drops,\u201d which are seemingly legitimate web pages that the hackers created, but which were surreptitiously encoded instructions to their malware.\u00a0 However, they also employed publicly available exploits and tools, including the following common vulnerabilities and exposures (\u201cCVE\u201d): \u00a0CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-2019-1652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189.</p>\n<p>The second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32, both Malaysian nationals and residents, with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the CFAA, and falsely registering domain names.\u00a0 The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling conducted the affairs of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian company founded by Wong, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses targeting the video game industry in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.\u00a0 The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and Tan, to profit from the hackers\u2019 criminal computer intrusions at video game companies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment against Zhang and Tan charges the defendants with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; nine counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; four counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The indictment against Jiang, Qian, and Fu charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The indictment against Wong and Ling charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of racketeering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; three counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; five counts of furthering fraud by unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; two counts of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\u00a0 The indictment also alleges false registration of domain names, which would increase the maximum sentence of imprisonment for money laundering to 27 years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for unlawful access to a protected computer to 10 years instead of five years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for intentional damage to a protected computer to 17 years instead of 10 years; and the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for aggravated identity theft to four years instead of two years.</p>\n<p>The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only; any sentencing's of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. \u00a0The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support. \u00a0Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The department is also grateful to Microsoft, including Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), to Google, including its Threat Analysis Group (TAG), to Facebook, and to Verizon Media, including its Paranoids Advanced Cyber Threats Team, for the assistance they provided in this investigation.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Demian Ahn of the District of Columbia, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal Chawla of the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney Evan Turgeon of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The details contained in the charging document are allegations.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey, elsewhere in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, the Department of Justice announced today.</p>\n<p>According to a 10-count indictment returned on Sept. 15, 2020, Hooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, stole hundreds of terabytes of data, which typically included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research.\u00a0 In some instances, the defendants\u2019 hacks were politically motivated or at the behest of Iran, including instances where they obtained information regarding dissidents, human rights activists, and opposition leaders.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants sold the hacked data and information on the black market for private financial gain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations \u2014 Iran, China, Russia and North Korea \u2014 will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government \u2014 gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d said George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment:</p>\n<p>Beginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities the defendants identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran.\u00a0 In addition to the theft of highly protected and sensitive data, the defendants also vandalized websites, often under the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>To select their victims, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance, including gathering public data and intelligence to determine a victim\u2019s areas of expertise, and using vulnerability scanning tools and other means to assess computer networks. \u00a0The defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.</p>\n<p>The defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.</p>\n<p>Each defendant is charged with: one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; unauthorized access to protected computers; unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p>The counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, and unauthorized access to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The counts of unauthorized damage to protected computers and access device fraud each carry a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.\u00a0 The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.</p>\n<p>The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p></div>",

Demers. \u201cTheir misguided, illegal actions in support of a rogue, destabilizing regime will come back to haunt them, as they are now fugitives from justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForeign hackers are a persistent commercial and national security threat to the United States,\u201d said United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. \u201cWorking with our law enforcement partners worldwide, we will aggressively pursue, prosecute and apprehend those who use the internet to attack American interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese hackers are accused of orchestrating a brazen cyber-assault that defaced scores of websites across the country as a way of protesting and retaliating against the United States for killing the leader of a foreign terrorist organization. Now, they are wanted by the FBI and are no longer free to travel outside Iran or Palestine without risk of arrest,\u201d said Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment\u00a0should send a powerful message that we will not hesitate to go after anyone who commits malicious cyber intrusions against innocent Americans in order to cause chaos, fear, and economic harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Mohammadzadeh has publicly claimed to have personally defaced more than 1,100 websites around the world with pro-Iranian and pro-hacker messages, which he began in 2018 and continues through the present day. Abusrour is a self-described spammer (sender of unsolicited emails for profit), carder (illicit trader in stolen credit cards) and black hat hacker (a hacker who violates computer security for personal gain or maliciousness) who has publicly claimed to have defaced at least 337 websites around the world, which he began no later than June 6, 2016, and continued through at least July 2020.</p>\n<p>The defendants allegedly started working together on or about Dec. 26, 2019, when Abusrour began providing Mahammadzadeh with access to compromised websites. On or about Jan. 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense issued a statement that the United States military had \u201ctaken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The statement explained that the \u201cstrike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans\u201d and described briefly General Soleimani\u2019s past actions and future plans. The United States\u2019 responsibility for General Soleimani\u2019s death was widely publicized.</p>\n<p>Following this statement, and in retaliation for it, Mohammadzadeh allegedly transmitted computer code to approximately 51 websites hosted in the United States, and defaced those websites by replacing their content with pictures of the late General Soleimani against a background of the Iranian flag along with the message, in English, \u201cDown with America,\u201d and other text. Some of the websites defaced were hosted on computers owned by a company with corporate headquarters in Massachusetts. No later than Jan. 7, 2020, Abusrour provided Mohammadzadeh with access to at least seven websites, which they defaced with a similar image and text. The defendants took credit online for their website defacements.</p>\n<p>The charge of conspiring to commit intentional damage to a protected computer provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gain or loss, whichever is greatest. The charge of intentionally damaging a protected computer provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gain or loss, whichever is greatest. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; \u00a0and Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division made this announcement.

Drozd to 11 years in prison.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Bryan Connor Herrell, 26, of Aurora, Colorado, was a moderator on the AlphaBay marketplace, an illegal website that operated on the so-called darknet. \u00a0On AlphaBay, vendors and purchasers engaged in hundreds of thousands of illicit transactions for guns, drugs, stolen identity information, credit card numbers and other illegal items. \u00a0At the time, AlphaBay was the world\u2019s largest online drug marketplace.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sentence of an AlphaBay employee demonstrates the collective efforts of law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe to find and prosecute transnational criminal actors wherever they hide,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe department will continue to work tirelessly to hold accountable criminals who use the Dark Web to facilitate illegal activity no matter where they may be located.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sentence serves as further proof that criminals cannot hide behind technology to break the law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott of the Eastern District of California. \u00a0\u201cOperating behind the veil of the darknet may seem to offer shelter from criminal investigations, but people should think twice before ordering or selling drugs online\u2014you will be caught. \u00a0This office will continue using all means available to pursue darknet-based crimes, particularly those involving fentanyl, opioids, and other dangerous drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is committed to developing highly trained cyber investigators who work with our international partners and perpetually evolve to counter the threat darknet criminals pose. \u00a0Cases like these exemplify how the FBI and our international partners are eliminating the false promise of anonymity dark marketplaces claim to provide and are successfully dismantling criminal organizations which prey upon communities through use of sophisticated computer code,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan of the FBI\u2019s Sacramento Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cHerrell's sentence sends a clear message to criminals that the darknet is no safe haven for illegal transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p>As a moderator on AlphaBay, Herrell settled disputes between vendors and purchasers. He is also served as a scam watcher \u2013 providing a service dedicated to monitor attempts to defraud AlphaBay users. \u00a0Herrell went by the monikers \u201cPenissmith\u201d and \u201cBotah\u201d and was paid in Bitcoin for his participation.</p>\n<p>On June 1, 2017, a Fresno grand jury indicted the alleged founder of AlphaBay, Alexandre Cazes. \u00a0On July 5, 2017, the Royal Thai Police, with assistance from the FBI and DEA, executed an arrest warrant for Alexandre Cazes at his residence in Bangkok, in connection with his alleged involvement with AlphaBay. \u00a0At the time of his arrest, law enforcement discovered Cazes\u2019s laptop open and in an unencrypted state. \u00a0Agents and officers found several text files that identified the passwords/passkeys for the AlphaBay website, the AlphaBay servers, and other online identities associated with AlphaBay. \u00a0The indictment against Cazes was dismissed as a result of his death. \u00a0The investigation of AlphaBay and its former administrators continues.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Sacramento and Philadelphia Field Offices investigated this case. \u00a0Senior Counsel Louisa K. Marion of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul Hemesath and Grant B. Rabenn are prosecuting the case. \u00a0The Philadelphia and Denver U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices provided substantial assistance.</p>\n<p>The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 Learn more about the history of our agency at <a href=\"http://www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years\">www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years</a>.</p></div>",

Claxton for the Western District of Tennessee.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that various Africa-based co-conspirators committed, or caused to be committed, a series of intrusions into the servers and email systems of a Memphis-based real estate company in June and July 2016.\u00a0 Using sophisticated anonymization techniques, including the use of spoofed email addresses and Virtual Private Networks, the co-conspirators identified large financial transactions, initiated fraudulent email correspondence with relevant business parties and then redirected closing funds through a network of U.S.-based money mules to final destinations in Africa.\u00a0 Commonly referred to as business-email compromise, or BEC, this aspect of the scheme caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to companies and individuals in Memphis.\u00a0 The defendant is specifically alleged to have directed the transfer of funds from a June 2016 BEC to a co-conspirator in Africa.</p>\n<p>In addition to BEC, the defendant is also charged with perpetrating romance scams, fraudulent-check scams, gold-buying scams, advance-fee scams and credit card scams.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that the proceeds of these criminal activities, both money and goods, were shipped and/or transferred from the United States to locations in Africa through a complex network of both complicit and unwitting individuals that had been recruited through the various Internet scams.\u00a0 The defendant is specifically alleged to have created and used the alias \u201cSandra Lin\u201d in furtherance of these crimes.\u00a0 From May through June of 2017, Peter is alleged to have communicated with an FBI agent acting in an undercover capacity to receive the proceeds of fraud.\u00a0 Along with his coconspirators over the life of the conspiracy, the defendant is believed to have caused millions of dollars in losses to victims across the globe.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Seven other individuals have pleaded guilty to being involved in these schemes.\u00a0 Benard E.

Rabbitt of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u00a0\u201cFortunately, by working with our law enforcement partners across the United States and overseas, we were able to uncover this darknet opioid market and bring to justice those responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese charges are a warning to drug traffickers worldwide that neither the shroud of the darknet or of virtual currency can hide their illegal activities from the vigilance of U.S. law enforcement,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin for the District of Columbia.\u00a0 \u201cWe are firmly committed to combatting the problem of opioid abuse and breaking through sophisticated cyber-enabled barriers employed by criminals to hide their activities.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe opioid epidemic is a crisis crippling many families in this country,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Kelly R. Jackson of the IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Washington D.C. Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cThis international group profited off of people\u2019s addictions, revictimizing them when they were already vulnerable. This group purposely distributed opioids that did not contain a safety additive and prevented inhalation of the drug.\u00a0 Years ago when drug dealers and traffickers moved to the darknet and started using virtual currency to conceal and expand their network, CI also moved our playing field to the darknet to bring groups like this to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s case is a great example of how the DEA has infiltrated the darknet and, together with our law enforcement partners, proven that every criminal attempting to sell these deadly drugs is within the reach of the law,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Jesse R. Fong of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) Washington Field Division.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Pate illegally purchased narcotics, including OxyContin and morphine pills, primarily from Fung, a pharmacist in Costa Rica.\u00a0 Pate would launder payments to Fung to purchase narcotics.\u00a0 Pate then sold these narcotics on numerous darknet markets, including Silk Road and AlphaBay, in exchange for bitcoin.\u00a0 Pate utilized various online monikers including \u201cbuyersclub\u201d on darknet markets, online forums, and bitcoin exchanges.\u00a0 Pate advertised that he was selling the \u201cold formula\u201d of OxyContin, which did not contain tamper-resistant features such as a crush-proof feature that prevented a user from inhaling or injecting the pills after pulverizing them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that Pate\u2019s darknet sales involved him sending bulk shipments of narcotics in pill form from Costa Rica, often concealed in tourist souvenirs such as maracas, to co-conspirator re-shippers in the United States.\u00a0 Pate would then send the re-shippers a list of customer orders, which included customer\u2019s names, the customer\u2019s shipping address, and the quantity of pills they purchased.\u00a0 The re-shippers created smaller packages of pills, which they then mailed to the customer.\u00a0 Once the shipments were received by the customer, the darknet market would release funds in bitcoin, which were held in escrow until the transaction was completed, into Pate\u2019s account on the darknet market.\u00a0 Customers paid Pate over 23,903 bitcoin for these darknet market sales.\u00a0 The co-conspirators also laundered payments in the form of bitcoin and international wire transfers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges in the pleadings are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit, DEA, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigated this case.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and Costa Rican authorities provided assistance.</p>\n<p>The case is being handled by Trial Attorney C.

Rabbitt of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe Justice Department is committed to unmasking cyber criminals and their criminal organizations that use the internet for fraudulent schemes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHSI and our partners are at the forefront of combating financial crimes and illicit activities spread on the Internet,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Francisco Burrola for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Las Vegas Office. \u00a0\u201cWhile criminal operators may continue to grow the reach of their criminal activity, ultimately they do not escape the reach of law enforcement. We continue to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle hidden illegal networks that pose a threat in cyberspace.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the Infraud Organization was created in October 2010 by Medvedev and Svyatoslav Bondarenko, aka \u201cObnon,\u201d \u201cRector,\u201d and \u201cHelkern,\u201d 34, of Ukraine, to promote and grow interest in the Infraud Organization as the premier destination for \u201ccarding\u201d \u2014purchasing retail items with counterfeit or stolen credit card information \u2014 on the Internet.\u00a0 Under the slogan, \u201cIn Fraud We Trust,\u201d the organization directed traffic and potential purchasers to the automated vending sites of its members, which served as online conduits to traffic in stolen means of identification, stolen financial and banking information, malware, and other illicit goods.\u00a0 It also provided an escrow service to facilitate illicit digital currency transactions among its members and employed screening protocols that purported to ensure only high quality vendors of stolen cards, personally identifiable information, and other contraband were permitted to advertise to members.\u00a0 In March 2017, there were 10,901 registered members of the Infraud Organization.</p>\n<p>Bondarenko currently remains a fugitive. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Chiochiu provided guidance to other Infraud members on the development, deployment, and use of malware as a means of harvesting stolen data. \u00a0As part of his plea agreement, Chiochiu admitted to authoring a strain of malware known to the computer security community as \u201cFastPOS\u201d.</p>\n<p>During the course of its seven-year history, the Infraud Organization inflicted approximately $2.2 billion in intended losses, and more than $568 million in actual losses, on a wide swath of financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals, and would have continued to do so for the foreseeable future if left unchecked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted by the Las Vegas Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations and the Henderson, Nevada Police Department.\u00a0 The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California also provided assistance with Chiochiu\u2019s case.\u00a0 Deputy Chief Kelly Pearson and Trial Attorneys Chad W.

Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Division\u00a0 Raymond Duda.</p>\n<p>\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange\u00a0for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington.\u00a0 As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen.\u00a0 The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security.\u00a0 This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00a0 We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.</p>\n<p>\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs.\u00a0 In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability.\u00a0 The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications.\u00a0 The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (<i>e.g.</i>, the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.</p>\n<p>To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (<i>e.g.</i>, from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.\u00a0 In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.</p>\n<p>The indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. \u00a0Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.</p>\n<p>The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. \u00a0The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio and Norfolk Field Offices.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with \u00a0FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support.\u00a0 Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The details contained in the charging document are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cToday's actions underscore that the Department will pierce the veil of anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are located.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, we are publicly exposing a criminal network\u2019s valuable support to North Korea\u2019s cyber heist program and seizing the fruits of its crimes,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u00a0\u201cThis case exemplifies the commitment of the United States government to work with foreign partners and the worldwide financial services industry to disrupt this blended threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money laundering for the benefit of North Korean actors poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea of the District of Columbia.\u00a0 \u201cThese charges should serve as a reminder that law enforcement, through its partnerships and collaboration, will uncover illegal activity here and abroad, and charge those responsible for unlawful acts and seize illicit funds even when in the form of virtual currency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNorth Korea continues to attack the growing worldwide ecosystem of virtual currency as a means to bypass the sanctions imposed on it by the United States and the United Nations Security Council.\u00a0 IRS-CI is committed to combatting the means and methods used by foreign and domestic adversaries to finance operations and activities that pose a threat to U.S. national security,\u201d said Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Don Fort.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to push our agency to the forefront of complex cyber investigations and work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to ensure these nefarious criminals are stopped and that the integrity of the United States financial system is preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will continue to actively work with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to identify and mitigate illicit movement of currency,\u201d said Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s indictment and sanctions send a strong message that the United States will not relent in holding accountable bad actors attempting to evade sanctions and undermine our financial system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case shows how important robust partnerships across the U.S. Government are in disrupting criminal actors,\u201d said Acting Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment shows what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to uncover complex cross-border crimes,\u201d said Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\u00a0 \u201cHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would steal cryptocurrency for their illicit purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the pleadings, in 2018, North Korean co-conspirators hacked into a virtual currency exchange and stole nearly $250 million worth of virtual currency.\u00a0 The funds were then laundered through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions aimed at preventing law enforcement from tracing the funds.\u00a0 The North Korean co-conspirators circumvented multiple virtual currency exchanges\u2019 know-your-customer controls by submitting doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation.\u00a0 A portion of the laundered funds was used to pay for infrastructure used in North Korean hacking campaigns against the financial industry.</p>\n<p>The pleadings further allege that between December 2017 and April 2019, Yinyin and Jiadong laundered over $100 million worth of virtual currency, which primarily came from virtual currency exchange hacks.\u00a0 The defendants operated through independent as well as linked accounts and provided virtual currency transmission services for a fee for customers.\u00a0 The defendants conducted business in the United States but at no time registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).</p>\n<p>The pleadings further allege that the North Korean co-conspirators are tied to the theft of approximately $48.5 million worth of virtual currency from a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange in November 2019.\u00a0 As with the prior campaign, the North Korean co-conspirators are alleged to have laundered the stolen funds through hundreds of automated transactions and submitted doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation.\u00a0 The pleadings identify how the North Korean co-conspirators used infrastructure in North Korea as part of this campaign.</p>\n<p>The civil forfeiture complaint specifically names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that were used by the defendants and unnamed co-conspirators to launder funds.\u00a0 The forfeiture complaint seeks to recover the funds, a portion of which has already been seized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges in the pleadings are merely allegations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also imposed sanctions on Yinyin, Liadong, and numerous cryptocurrency addresses related to their involvement in activities facilitating North Korean sanctions evasion based on their services and support for malicious cyber enabled activities linked to North Korean actors.</p>\n<p>The investigation was led by the IRS-CI, the FBI, and HSI.\u00a0 The Korean National Police of the Republic of Korea provided assistance and coordinated with their parallel investigation.</p>\n<p>The cases are being handled by Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney David Recker of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Zia Faruqui and Christopher B.

Barr, who made the announcement.\u00a0\u201cToday, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet\u2019s cloak of anonymity\u00a0and find\u00a0the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys\u00a0against\u00a0us.\u00a0Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China\u00a0and its\u00a0citizens that\u00a0have targeted personally\u00a0identifiable information, trade secrets,\u00a0and other confidential\u00a0information.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax\u2019s online dispute portal. \u00a0They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax\u2019s online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax\u2019s network. \u00a0The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax\u2019s database structure and searching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax\u2019s system. \u00a0Once they accessed files of interest, the conspirators then stored the stolen information in temporary output files, compressed and divided the files, and ultimately were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax\u2019s network to computers outside the United States. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax\u2019s system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security numbers for nearly half of all American citizens.</p>\n<p>The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax\u2019s data compilations and database designs. \u00a0\u201cIn short, this was an organized and remarkably brazen criminal heist of sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans, as well as the hard work and intellectual property of an American company, by a unit of the Chinese military,\u201d said Barr.</p>\n<p>The defendants took steps to evade detection throughout the intrusion, as alleged in the indictment. \u00a0They routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax\u2019s network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement of these indictments further highlights our commitment to imposing consequences on cybercriminals no matter who they are, where they are, or what country\u2019s uniform they wear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.\u00a0 \u201cThe size and scope of this investigation \u2014 affecting nearly half of the U.S. population, demonstrates the importance of the FBI\u2019s mission and our enduring partnerships with the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u00a0 This is not the end of our investigation; to all who seek to disrupt the safety, security and confidence of the global citizenry in this digitally connected world, this is a day of reckoning.\u201d</p>\n<p>The defendants are charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. \u00a0The defendants are also charged with two counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of economic espionage, and three counts of wire fraud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Criminal and National Security Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Atlanta Field Office.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division also provided support.\u00a0 Equifax cooperated fully and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathan Kitchens, Samir Kaushal, and Thomas Krepp of the Northern District of Georgia; Senior Counsel Benjamin Fitzpatrick of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case. \u00a0Attorneys with the Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in obtaining evidence from overseas.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The details contained in the charging document are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 Learn more about the history of our agency at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/Celebrating150Years?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\"><u>www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years</u></a>.</p></div>",

Yakubets, aka online moniker, \u201caqua,\u201d 32, of Moscow, Russia, related to two separate international computer hacking and bank fraud schemes spanning from May 2009 to the present. \u00a0A second individual, Igor Turashev, 38, from Yoshkar-Ola, Russia, was also indicted in Pittsburgh for his role related to the \u201cBugat\u201d malware conspiracy. The State Department, in partnership with the FBI, announced today a reward of up to $5 million under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Yakubets.\u00a0 This represents the largest such reward offer for a cyber criminal to date.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania, U.S. Attorney Joseph P. Kelly for the District of Nebraska, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary James A. Walsh of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and Director Rob Jones of the Cyber Crime Unit \u00a0at the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) made the announcement.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaksim Yakubets allegedly has engaged in a decade-long cybercrime spree that deployed two of the most damaging pieces of financial malware ever used and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to victims worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThese two cases demonstrate our commitment to unmasking the perpetrators behind the world\u2019s most egregious cyberattacks.\u00a0 The assistance of our international partners, in particular the National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom, was crucial to our efforts to identify Yakubets and his co-conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor over a decade, Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev led one of the most sophisticated transnational cybercrime syndicates in the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Brady. \u201cDeploying \u2018Bugat\u2019 malware, also known as \u2018Cridex\u2019 and \u2018Dridex,\u2019 these cybercriminals targeted individuals and companies in western Pennsylvania and across the globe in one of the most widespread malware campaigns we have ever encountered. \u00a0International cybercriminals who target Pennsylvania citizens and companies are no different than any other criminal: they will be investigated, prosecuted and held accountable for their actions.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Zeus scheme was one of the most outrageous cybercrimes in history,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Kelly.\u00a0 \u201cOur identification of Yakubets as the actor who used the moniker \u2018aqua\u2019 in that scheme, as alleged in the complaint unsealed today, is a prime example of how we will pursue cyber criminals to the ends of justice no matter how long it takes, by tracking their activity both online and off and working with our international partners to expose their crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement involved a long running investigation of a sophisticated organized cybercrime syndicate,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Bowdich. \u201cThe charges highlight the persistence of the FBI and our partners to vigorously pursue those who desire to profit from innocent people through deception and theft. By calling out those who threaten American businesses and citizens, we expose criminals who hide behind devices and launch attacks that threaten our public safety and economic stability. The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cyber-criminal activity emanating from Russian actors, were particularly damaging as they targeted U.S. entities across all sectors and walks of life. The FBI, with the assistance of private industry and our international and U.S. government partners, is sending a strong message that we will work together to investigate and hold all criminals accountable. Our memory is long and we will hold them accountable under the law, no matter where they attempt to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCombatting cybercrime remains a top national security priority for to the United States,\u201d said INL Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Walsh. \u201cThe announcements today represent a coordinated interagency effort to bring Maksim Yakubets to justice and to address cybercrime globally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a landmark for the NCA, FBI and U.S. authorities and a day of reckoning for those who commit cybercrime,\u201d said NCA Director Jones. \u201cFollowing years of online pursuit, I am pleased to see the real world identity of Yakubets and his associate Turashev revealed.\u00a0 Yakubets and his associates have allegedly been responsible for losses and attempted losses totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. This is not a victimless crime, those losses were once people\u2019s life savings, now emptied from their bank accounts.\u00a0 Today the process of bringing Yakubets and his criminal associates to justice begins.\u00a0 This is not the end of our investigation, and we will continue to work closely with international partners to present a united front against criminality that threatens our prosperity and security.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Yakubets and Turashev Indicted in Relation to \u201cBugat\u201d Malware</i></p>\n<p>A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh returned a 10-count indictment, which was unsealed today, against Yakubets and Turashev, charging them with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, and bank fraud, in connection with the distribution of \u201cBugat,\u201d a multifunction malware package designed to automate the theft of confidential personal and financial information, such as online banking credentials, from infected computers. \u00a0Later versions of the malware were designed with the added function of assisting in the installation of ransomware.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Bugat is a malware specifically crafted to defeat antivirus and other protective measures employed by victims.\u00a0 As the individuals behind Bugat improved the malware and added functionality, the name of the malware changed, at one point being called \u201cCridex,\u201d and later \u201cDridex,\u201d according to the indictment.\u00a0 Bugat malware was allegedly designed to automate the theft of confidential personal and financial information, such as online banking credentials, and facilitated the theft of confidential personal and financial information by a number of methods.\u00a0 For example, the indictment alleges that the Bugat malware allowed computer intruders to hijack a computer session and present a fake online banking webpage to trick a user into entering personal and financial information.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that Yakubets and Turashev used captured banking credentials to cause banks to make unauthorized electronic funds transfers from the victims\u2019 bank accounts, without the knowledge or consent of the account holders. \u00a0They then allegedly used persons, known as \u201cmoney mules,\u201d to receive stolen funds into their bank accounts, and then move the money to other accounts or withdraw the funds and transport the funds overseas as smuggled bulk cash.\u00a0 According to the indictment, they also used a powerful online tool known as a botnet in furtherance of the scheme.</p>\n<p>Yakubets was the leader of the group of conspirators involved with the Bugat malware and botnet, according to the indictment.\u00a0 As the leader, he oversaw and managed the development, maintenance, distribution, and infection of Bugat as well as the financial theft and the use of money mules.\u00a0 Turashev allegedly handled a variety of functions for the Bugat conspiracy, including system administration, management of the internal control panel, and oversight of botnet operations.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Yakubets and Turashev victimized multiple entities, including two banks, a school district, and four companies including a petroleum business, building materials supply company, vacuum and thin film deposition technology company and metal manufacturer in the Western District of Pennsylvania and a firearm manufacturer.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that these attacks resulted in the theft of millions of dollars, and occurred as recently as March 19, 2019.</p>\n<p><i>Yakubets Charged in Relation to \u201cZeus\u201d Malware</i></p>\n<p>A criminal complaint was also unsealed in Lincoln today charging Yakubets with conspiracy to commit bank fraud in connection with the \u201cZeus\u201d malware.\u00a0 Beginning in May 2009, Yakubets and multiple co-conspirators are alleged to have a long-running conspiracy to employ widespread computer intrusions, malicious software, and fraud to steal millions of dollars from numerous bank accounts in the United States and elsewhere.\u00a0 Yakubets and his co-conspirators allegedly infected thousands of business computers with malicious software that captured passwords, account numbers, and other information necessary to log into online banking accounts, and then used the captured information to steal money from victims\u2019 bank accounts.\u00a0 As with Bugat, the actors involved with the Zeus scheme were alleged to have employed the use of money mules and a botnet.</p>\n<p>Yakubets and his co-conspirators are alleged to have victimized 21 specific municipalities, banks, companies, and non-profit organizations in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington, identified in the complaint, including multiple entities in Nebraska and a religious congregation.\u00a0 According to the complaint, the deployment of the Zeus malware resulted overall in the attempted theft of an estimated $220 million USD, with actual losses of an estimated $70 million USD from victims\u2019 bank accounts.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Yakubets\u2019 role in the Zeus scheme was to provide money mules and their associated banking credentials in order to facilitate the movement of money, which was withdrawn from victim accounts by fraudulent means.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An individual charged as John Doe #2, also known as \u201caqua,\u201d was indicted in District of Nebraska in case number 4:11-CR-3074.\u00a0 The indictment in that case charges that individual and others with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and multiple counts of bank fraud related to the Zeus scheme.\u00a0 As alleged, the complaint unsealed today associates use of the moniker \u201caqua\u201d in the Zeus scheme to Yakubets.</p>\n<p>In case number 4:11-CR-3074, two of the co-conspirators of \u201caqua,\u201d Ukrainian nationals <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-charged-conspiracy-steal-millions-dollars-using-zeus-malware\"><u>Yuriy Konovaleko and Yevhen Kulibaba</u></a>, were extradited from the United Kingdom to the United States.\u00a0 Konovalenko and Kulibaba both pleaded guilty in 2015 to conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity and have completed prison sentences that were imposed.\u00a0 Konovalenko and Kulibaba were previously convicted in the United Kingdom, after an investigation conducted by the Metropolitan Police Service, for their role in laundering \u00a33 million GBP on behalf of the group responsible for the Zeus malware.</p>\n<p><i>State Department $5 million USD Reward</i></p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information on Yakubets.\u00a0 Cyber threats are a top national security threat to the United States, and the Department of State\u2019s TOC Rewards Program is one of the many tools used by U.S. authorities to bring significant cybercriminals to justice.\u00a0 Congress established the TOC Rewards Program in 2013 to support law enforcement efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and bring their leaders and members to justice.\u00a0 The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the program in coordination with other U.S. federal agencies.</p>\n<p>In addition to NCA, the law enforcement actions taken related to these two prosecutions were assisted by the efforts of law enforcement counterparts from The Netherlands, Germany, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh and Omaha Field Offices led the investigations of Yakubets and Turashev with assistance by the FBI\u2019s Major Cyber Crimes Unit and Global Operations and Targeting Unit.\u00a0 The prosecution in Pittsburgh is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shardul S. Desai of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the prosecution in Lincoln is being handled by Senior Counsel William A. Hall, Jr., of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven A. Russell of the District of Nebraska.\u00a0 The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance throughout the criminal investigations.\u00a0 The Department\u2019s National Security Division also provided investigative assistance.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The details contained in the indictment, criminal complaint and related pleadings are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson of the Northern District of California and Special Agent in Charge Kelly R. Jackson of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>On July 25, 2019, a federal grand jury indicted Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, 45, and his company, Eastern Metal Securities (EMS), charging the defendants with engaging in a scheme to defraud victims of more than $11 million.\u00a0 Karlsson was arrested June 17, 2019, in Thailand.</p>\n<p>According to a complaint filed March 4, 2019, in connection with the case, since September 2006, Karlsson, also known by several aliases, including Steve Heyden, Euclid Deodoris, Joshua Millard, Lars Georgsson, Paramon Larasoft and Kenth Westerberg, used websites to communicate false representations to victims in a scheme to defraud potential investors.\u00a0 For example, one website, <a href=\"http://www.easternmetalsecurities.com/\"><u>www.easternmetalsecurities.com</u></a>, allegedly was registered to a fictitious person and advertised shares in a product called a \u201cPre Funded Reversed Pension Plan\u201d (PFRPP).\u00a0 The indictment alleges Karlsson used the website to invite potential investors to purchase shares of the plan for $98 per share in exchange for an eventual payout of 1.15 kilograms of gold per share, even though as of Jan. 2, 2019, 1.15 kilograms of gold was worth more than $45,000.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Karlsson also allegedly advised investors that, in the unlikely event that the gold payout did not happen, he guaranteed to them 97 percent of the amount they invested. \u00a0According to the complaint, the government found no evidence of any accounts held by Karlsson that would allow him to pay off the investors.\u00a0 Instead, the complaint alleges, the funds provided by victims were transferred to Karlsson\u2019s personal bank accounts and now appear to be tied up in real estate in Thailand.</p>\n<p>The complaint further describes how Karlsson allegedly used a second website, <a href=\"http://www.hci25.com/\"><u>www.hci25.com</u></a>, to make multiple false communications to potential investors.\u00a0 Karlsson allegedly brought the investors in HCI25 together with the investors in the PFRPP and posted multiple communications to delay the moment investors would realize there would be no payout.\u00a0 For example, on one occasion, Karlsson allegedly explained that a payout had not occurred because releasing so much money all at once could cause a negative effect on financial systems throughout the world.\u00a0 Karlsson also falsely represented that EMS was working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare the way for a payout.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges Karlsson directed his victims to make investments using virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin.\u00a0 Karlsson allegedly defrauded no less than 3,575 victims of more than $11 million.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Catherine Alden Pelker of the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney William Frentzen of the Northern District of California are prosecuting this case with the assistance of Bridget Kilkenny.\u00a0 This prosecution is the result of an investigation by the IRS-CI Washington, D.C. Cyber Crimes Unit. \u00a0The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 Office in Thailand, the IRS Criminal Investigation Attach\u00e9 Office in Hong Kong and the Royal Thai Police Crime Suppression Division provided significant assistance.</p></div>",

The indictment further alleges that threats were made with the intent to injure and intimidate D.G., and were part of a course of conduct that caused D.G. to fear death and serious bodily injury.\u00a0 The charges of cyberstalking and transmitting threats in interstate commerce carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The two charges arising from the threats against D.G. because of his race and because he was campaigning for elected office each carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This case is being investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Thomas T. Cullen, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh, and Trial Attorney Risa Berkower of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division.</p>\n<p>An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence of guilt. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p></div>",

This is often accomplished by impersonating a key employee or business partner after obtaining access to that person\u2019s email account or sometimes done through romance and lottery scams.\u00a0 BEC scams may involve fraudulent requests for checks rather than wire transfers; they may target sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or employee tax records instead of, or in addition to, money; and they may not involve an actual \u201ccompromise\u201d of an email account or computer network.\u00a0 Foreign citizens perpetrate many BEC scams.\u00a0 Those individuals are often members of transnational criminal organizations, which originated in Nigeria but have spread throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Department of Justice has increased efforts in taking aggressive enforcement action against fraudsters who are targeting American citizens and their businesses in business email compromise schemes and other cyber-enabled financial crimes,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. \u00a0\u201cIn this latest four-month operation, we have arrested 74 people in the United States and 207 others have been arrested overseas for alleged financial fraud. The coordinated efforts with our domestic and international law enforcement partners around the world has made these most recent actions more successful. I want to thank the FBI, more than two dozen U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations, IRS Criminal Investigation, U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, our partners in Nigeria, Ghana, Turkey, France, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, and the UK, and our state and local law enforcement partners for all of their hard work to combat these fraud schemes and protect the hard-earned assets of our citizens. \u00a0Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI is working every day to disrupt and dismantle the criminal enterprises that target our businesses and our citizens,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u00a0\u201cCooperation is the backbone to effective law enforcement; without it, we aren\u2019t as strong or as agile as we need to be.\u00a0 Through Operation reWired, we\u2019re sending a clear message to the criminals who orchestrate these BEC schemes: We\u2019ll keep coming after you, no matter where you are. \u00a0And to the public, we\u2019ll keep doing whatever we can to protect you. \u00a0Reporting incidents of BEC and other internet-enabled crimes to the IC3 brings us one step closer to the perpetrators.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Secret Service has taken a multi-layered approach to combating Business Email Compromise schemes through our Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC),\u201d said U.S. Secret Service Director James M. Murray. \u201cDomestically, the GIOC assists Secret Service Field Offices and other law enforcement partners with analysis and investigative tactics to enhance the impact of local BEC investigations.\u00a0 Internationally, the GIOC targets and identifies transnational organized crime networks that perpetrate these cyber-enabled financial fraud schemes.\u00a0 Through this approach, the Secret Service continues to strive to protect the citizens of the United States and our financial infrastructure from these complex crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHomeland Security Investigations (HSI), together with its law enforcement partners, has proven once again, that cyber-enabled financial fraud will not be tolerated in the United States,\u201d said Acting Director Matthew T. Albence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \u201cOperation reWired sends a clear message to criminals, that no matter how or where crimes are committed, we will do everything within our means to dismantle criminal enterprises that seek to manipulate U.S. institutions and taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe consequences of this type of fraud scheme are far reaching, affecting not only people in the United States, but also across the world,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale. \u00a0\u201cThis investigation is just another example of how effective law enforcement agencies can be when they join forces.\u00a0 By working together, we can keep our communities and our vulnerable populations safe from financial exploitation.\u00a0 The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is proud to be at the forefront of the fight against fraud and Postal Inspectors will continue to adapt to the ever changing landscape to stop the scammers and protect our customers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn unraveling this complex, nationwide identity theft and tax fraud scheme, we discovered that the conspirators stole more than 250,000 identities and filed more than 10,000 fraudulent tax returns, attempting to receive more than $91 million in refunds,\u201d said Chief Don Fort of IRS Criminal Investigation.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work with our international, federal and state partners to pursue all those responsible for perpetrating this fraud, preying on innocent victims and attempting to cheat the U.S. out of millions of dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe investigation of these crimes crossed international borders,\u201d said Director Todd J. Brown of the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s charges are another successful example of our commitment to working together with both foreign\u00a0colleagues abroad as well as local, state and federal law enforcement partners here at home in the pursuit of those who commit cyber-related financial crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>A number of cases involved international criminal organizations that defrauded small to large sized businesses, while others involved individual victims who transferred high dollar funds or sensitive records in the course of business.\u00a0 The devastating effects these cases have on victims and victim companies affect not only the individual business but also the global economy.\u00a0 According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), nearly $1.3 billion in loss was reported in 2018 from BEC and its variant, Email Account Compromise (EAC), nearly twice as much as was reported the prior year.\u00a0 BEC and EAC are prevalent scams and the Justice Department along with our partners will continue to aggressively pursue and prosecute the perpetrators, including money mules, regardless of where they are located.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Money mules may be witting or unwitting accomplices who receive ill-gotten funds from the victims and then transfer the funds as directed by the fraudsters.\u00a0 The money is wired or sent by check to the money mule who then deposits it in his or her own bank account.\u00a0 Usually the mules keep a fraction for \u201ctheir trouble\u201d and then wire the money as directed by the fraudster.\u00a0 The fraudsters enlist and manipulate the money mules through romance scams or \u201cwork-at-home\u201d scams, though some money mules are knowing co-conspirators who launder the ill-gotten gains for profit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>BEC scams are related to, and often conducted together with, other forms of fraud such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cRomance scams,\u201d where victims are lulled into believing they are in a legitimate relationship, and are tricked into sending or laundering money under the guise of assisting the paramour with an international business transaction, a U.S. visit, or some other cover story;<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>\u201cEmployment opportunities scams,\u201d where victims are convinced to provide their PII to apply for work-from-home jobs, and, once \u201chired\u201d and \u201coverpaid\u201d by a bad check, to wire the overpayment to the \u201cemployer\u2019s\u201d bank before the check bounces;<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>\u201cFraudulent online vehicle sales scams,\u201d where victims are convinced they are purchasing a nonexistent vehicle and must pay for it by sending the codes of prepaid gift cards in the amount of the agreed upon sale price to the \u201cseller;\u201d<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>\u201cRental scams,\u201d where a scammer agrees to rent a property, sends a bad check in excess of the agreed upon deposit, and requests the overpayment be returned via wire before the check bounces; and<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>\u201cLottery scams,\u201d where victims are convinced they won an international lottery but must pay fees or taxes before receiving the payout.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting in May 2019, this coordinated enforcement action targeted hundreds of BEC scammers.\u00a0 Law enforcement agents executed over 214 domestic actions including arrests, money mule warning letters, and asset seizures and repatriations totaling nearly $3.7 million.\u00a0 Local and state law enforcement partners on FBI task forces across the country, with the assistance of multiple District Attorney\u2019s Offices, also arrested alleged money mules for their role in defrauding victims.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among those arrested on federal charges in BEC schemes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following an investigation led by the FBI\u2019s Chicago Division, Brittney Stokes, 27, of Country Club Hills, Illinois, and Kenneth Ninalowo, 40, of Chicago, Illinois, were charged in the Northern District of Illinois with laundering over $1.5 million from proceeds of BEC scams.\u00a0 According to the indictment, a community college and an energy company were defrauded into sending approximately $5 million to fraudulent bank accounts controlled by the scammers.\u00a0 Banks were able to freeze approximately $3.6 million of the $5 million defrauded in the two schemes.\u00a0 Law enforcement officials seized a 2019 Range Rover Velar S from Stokes and approximately $175,909 from Stokes and Ninalowo.\u00a0<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>As a result of a joint investigation by the FBI, HSI, and DSS, Opeyemi Adeoso, 44, of Dallas, Texas, and Benjamin Ifebajo, 45, of Richardson, Texas, were arrested and charged in the Northern District of Texas with bank fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. \u00a0Adeoso and Ifebajo are alleged to have received and laundered at least $3.4 million. \u00a0In furtherance of their scheme, they are alleged to have assumed 12 fictitious identities and defrauded 37 victims from across the United States.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>As part of a larger investigation by the FBI and the USSS in Miami, Yamel Guevara Tamayo, 36, of Miami, Florida, and Yumeydi Govantes, 39, of Miami, Florida, were charged in the Southern District of Florida with laundering more than $950,000 of proceeds of BEC scams.\u00a0 The two individuals were also responsible for recruiting approximately 18 other individuals to serve as money mules, who laundered proceeds of BEC scams for an international money laundering network.\u00a0 The victims of the BEC scams included title companies, corporations, and individuals.\u00a0 The individuals were indicted June 18, 2019 and arrested June 20, 2019.\u00a0 The change of plea for both individuals is scheduled for Sept. 16.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>In an investigation by FBI Atlanta, two individuals were charged in the Northern District of Georgia for their involvement in a Nigeria-based BEC scheme that began with a $3.5 million transfer of funds fraudulently misdirected from a Georgia-based health care provider to accounts across the United States.\u00a0 Two Nigerian nationals, Emmanuel Igomu, 35, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Jude Balogun, 29, of San Francisco, California, have been arrested on charges of aiding and abetting wire fraud for their part in receiving and transmitting monies derived from the BEC.\u00a0<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li>Following an investigation by the FBI, Cyril Ashu, 34, of Austell, Georgia; Ifeanyi Eke, 32, of Sandy Springs, Georgia; Joshua Ikejimba, 24, of Houston, Texas; and Chinedu Ironuah, 32, of Houston, Texas, were charged in the Southern District of New York with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud for their involvement in a Nigeria-based BEC scheme that impacted hundreds of victims in the United States, with losses in excess of $10 million.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The cases were investigated by the FBI, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), IRS Criminal Investigation and U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices in the Districts of Arizona;

gain unauthorized access to victims\u2019 online bank accounts; and,</li>\n<li>steal money from victims\u2019 bank accounts and launder those funds using U.S. and foreign beneficiary bank accounts controlled by the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The defendants reside in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria. \u00a0The operation was an unprecedented international

inability to extradite the remaining defendants to the United States for prosecution, an unprecedented effort was undertaken to share evidence and build prosecutions against defendants in the remaining countries where they reside, including Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova.\u00a0 The prosecutions are based on shared evidence acquired through coordinated searches for evidence in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, as well as from evidence shared by the United States and Germany from their respective investigations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The GozNym network exemplified the concept of \u201ccybercrime as a service.\u201d\u00a0 According to the Indictment, the defendants advertised their specialized technical skills and services on underground, Russian-language, online criminal forums.\u00a0 The GozNym network was formed when these individuals were recruited from the online forums and came together to use their specialized technical skills and services in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>According to the Indictment, Alexander Konovolov, aka \u201cNoNe,\u201d and \u201cnone_1,\u201d age 35, of Tbilisi, Georgia, was the primary organizer and leader of the GozNym network who controlled more than 41,000 victim computers infected with GozNym malware.\u00a0 Konovolov assembled the team of cybercriminals charged in the Indictment, in part by recruiting them through the underground online criminal forums.\u00a0 Marat Kazandjian, aka \u201cphant0m,\u201d age 31, of Kazakhstan and Tbilisi, Georgia, was allegedly Konovolov\u2019s primary assistant and technical administrator.\u00a0 Konovolov and Kazandjian are being prosecuted in Georgia for their respective roles in the GozNym criminal network.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gennady Kapkanov, aka \u201cHennadiy Kapkanov,\u201d \u201cflux,\u201d \u201cffhost,\u201d \u201cfirestarter,\u201d and \u201cUser 41,\u201d age 36, of Poltava, Ukraine, was an administrator of a bulletproof hosting service known by law enforcement and computer security researchers as the <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/%E2%80%98avalanche%E2%80%99-network-dismantled-in-international-cyber-operation\"><u>\u201cAvalanche\u201d network</u></a>.\u00a0 This network provided services to more than 200 cybercriminals, including Konovolov and Kazandjian, and it hosted more than 20 different malware campaigns, including GozNym.\u00a0 Kapkanov\u2019s apartment in Poltava, Ukraine was searched in November 2016 during a German-led operation to dismantle the network\u2019s servers and other infrastructure.\u00a0 Kapkanov was arrested for shooting an assault rifle through the door of his apartment at Ukrainian law enforcement officers conducting the search.\u00a0 Through the coordinated efforts being announced today, Kapkanov is now facing prosecution in Ukraine for his role in providing bulletproof hosting services to the GozNym criminal network.</p>\n<p>Alexander Van Hoof, aka \u201cal666,\u201d age 45, of Nikolaev, Ukraine, was a \u201ccash-out\u201d or \u201cdrop master\u201d who provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts he controlled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims\u2019 online bank accounts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eduard Malanici, aka \u201cJekaProf,\u201d and \u201cprocryptgroup, age 32, of Balti, Moldova, provided crypting services to cybercriminals.\u00a0 Malanici crypted GozNym malware in furtherance of the conspiracy to enable the malware to avoid detection by anti-virus tools and protective software on victims\u2019 computers.\u00a0 Malanici, along with two associates, is being prosecuted in Moldova.</p>\n<p>Victims of the GozNym malware attacks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An asphalt and paving business located in New Castle, Pennsylvania;</li>\n<li>A law firm located in Washington, DC;</li>\n<li>A church located in Southlake, Texas;</li>\n<li>An association dedicated to providing recreation programs and other services to persons with disabilities located in Downers Grove, Illinois;</li>\n<li>A distributor of neurosurgical and medical equipment headquartered in Freiburg, Germany, with a U.S. subsidiary in Cape Coral, Florida;</li>\n<li>A furniture business located in Chula Vista, California;</li>\n<li>A provider of electrical safety devices located in Cumberland, Rhode Island;</li>\n<li>A contracting business located in Warren, Michigan;</li>\n<li>A casino located in Gulfport, Mississippi;</li>\n<li>A stud farm located in Midway, Kentucky; and</li>\n<li>A law office located in Wellesley, Massachusetts;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Five Russian nationals charged in the Indictment who remain fugitives from justice include:</p>\n<p>Vladimir Gorin, aka \u201cVoland,\u201d\u00a0 \u201cmrv,\u201d and \u201criddler,\u201d of Orenburg, Russia.\u00a0 Gorin was a malware developer who oversaw the creation, development, management, and leasing of GozNym malware, including to Alexander Konovolov.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Konstantin Volchkov, aka \u201celvi,\u201d age 28, of Moscow, Russia, provided spamming services to cybercriminals.\u00a0 Volchkov conducted spamming operations of GozNym malware on behalf of the conspiracy.\u00a0 The spamming operations involved the mass distribution of GozNym malware through \u201cphishing\u201d emails.\u00a0 The phishing emails were designed to appear legitimate to entice the victim recipients into opening the emails and clicking on a malicious link or attachment, which facilitated the downloading of GozNym onto the victims\u2019 computers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ruslan Katirkin, aka \u201cstratos,\u201d and \u201cxen,\u201d age 31, of Kazan, Russia, resided in Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine, during the time frame of the charged conspiracy.\u00a0 Katirkin, like Krasimir Nikolov, was a \u201ccasher\u201d or \u201caccount takeover specialist\u201d who used victims\u2019 stolen online banking credentials captured by GozNym malware to access victims\u2019 online bank accounts and attempt to steal victims\u2019 money through electronic funds transfers into bank accounts controlled by fellow conspirators.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor Vladimirovich Eremenko, aka \u201cnfcorpi,\u201d age 30, of Stavropol, Russia, and Farkhad Rauf Ogly Manokhin, aka \u201cfrusa,\u201d of Volgograd, Russia, were \u201ccash-outs\u201d or \u201cdrop masters\u201d on behalf of the GozNym criminal network.\u00a0 Like Alexander Van Hoof, Eremenko and Manokhin provided fellow members of the conspiracy with access to bank accounts they controlled that were designated to receive stolen funds from GozNym victims\u2019 online bank accounts.\u00a0 Manokhin was arrested at the request of the United States while visiting Sri Lanka in February 2017.\u00a0 Following his arrest, Manokhin was released on bail but was required to remain in Sri Lanka pending the outcome of his extradition proceedings to the United States.\u00a0 In December 2017, Manokhin unlawfully absconded from Sri Lanka and successfully fled back to Russia prior to the conclusion of the extradition proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other agencies and organizations partnering in this effort include the United States Secret Service, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) in Pittsburgh and the Shadowserver Foundation. \u00a0The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance throughout the investigation and spearheaded the efforts to enable the United States to request searches, arrests, and extraditions in the foreign countries as well as the sharing of evidence with those countries through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty requests.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles A. \u201cTod\u201d Eberle, Chief of National Security and Cybercrime for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment unsealed today in Indianapolis, Indiana, charging a Chinese national as part of an extremely sophisticated hacking group operating in China and targeting large businesses in the United States, including a computer intrusion and data breach of Indianapolis-based health insurer Anthem Inc. (Anthem).</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler for the Southern District of Indiana, Assistant Director Matt Gorham of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division and Special Agent in Charge Grant Mendenhall of the FBI\u2019s Indianapolis Field office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>The four-count indictment alleges that Fujie Wang (\u738b \u798f \u6770 in Chinese Hanzi), 32, and other members of the hacking group, including another individual charged as John Doe, conducted a campaign of intrusions into U.S.-based computer systems.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that the defendants gained entry to the computer systems of Anthem and three other U.S. businesses, identified in the indictment as Victim Business 1, Victim Business 2 and Victim Business 3.\u00a0 As part of this international computer hacking scheme, the indictment alleges that beginning in February 2014, the defendants used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization, according to the indictment.\u00a0 They then installed malware and tools on the compromised computer systems to further compromise the computer networks of the victim businesses, after which they identified data of interest on the compromised computers, including personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential business information, the indictment alleges.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThese defendants allegedly attacked U.S. businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII.\u00a0 The Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are committed to protecting PII, and will aggressively prosecute perpetrators of hacking schemes like this, wherever they occur.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cyber attack of Anthem not only caused harm to Anthem, but also impacted tens of millions of Americans,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Minkler.\u00a0 \u201cThis wanton violation of privacy will not stand, and we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.\u00a0 I would also like to thank Anthem for its timely and substantial cooperation with our investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case is significant not only because it showcases the FBI\u2019s cyber investigative capabilities, but also because it highlights the importance of FBI and private industry relationships,\u201d said Assistant Director Matt Gorham. \u00a0\u201cBecause the victim companies promptly notified the FBI of malicious cyber activity, we were able to successfully investigate and identify the perpetrators of this large-scale, highly sophisticated scheme. The FBI is committed to investigating cyber-attacks that compromise American industry and the American people. As we did in this case, we will work side by side with victim companies to ensure justice is served.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Anthem's cooperation and openness in working with the FBI on the investigation of this sophisticated cyber-attack was imperative in allowing for the identification of these individuals. This also speaks to the strong partnerships the FBI has with the private sector, as well as the tenacity and global reach of the Bureau,\" said Special Agent in Charge Grant Mendenhall. \u00a0\"It should also be noted that the speed with which Anthem initially notified the FBI of the intrusion on their networks was also a key factor in being able to determine who was responsible for the breach and should serve as an example to other organizations that might find themselves in a similar situation.\"</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that the defendants then collected files and other information from the compromised computers and then stole this data.\u00a0 As part of the computer intrusion and data breach of Anthem, the defendants identified and ultimately stole data concerning approximately 78.8 million persons from Anthem\u2019s computer network, including names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information and income data, according to the indictment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wang and Doe are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in relation to computers and identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendants used extremely sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses.\u00a0 These techniques included the sending of specially-tailored \u201cspearfishing\u201d emails with embedded hyperlinks to employees of the victim businesses.\u00a0 After a user accessed the hyperlink, a file was downloaded which, when executed, deployed malware that would compromise the user\u2019s computer system by, in pertinent part, installing a tool known as a backdoor that would provide remote access to that computer system through a server controlled by the defendants.</p>\n<p>The defendants sometimes patiently waited months before taking further action, eventually engaging in reconnaissance by searching the network for data of interest, according to the indictment.\u00a0 This data included PII and confidential business information.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that the defendants accessed the computer network of Anthem without authorization for the purpose of conducting reconnaissance on Anthem\u2019s enterprise data warehouse, a system that stores a large amount of PII, on multiple occasions in October and November 2014.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that once the data of interest had been identified and located, the defendants then collected the relevant files and other information from the compromised computers using software tools.\u00a0 The defendants then allegedly stole the data of interest by placing it into encrypted archive files and then sending it through multiple computers to destinations in China.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that on multiple occasions in January 2015, the defendants accessed the computer network of Anthem, accessed Anthem\u2019s enterprise data warehouse, and transferred encrypted archive files containing PII from Anthem\u2019s enterprise data warehouse from the United States to China.</p>\n<p>Finally, the defendants allegedly then deleted the encrypted archive files from the computer networks of the victim businesses, in an attempt to avoid detection.\u00a0 In late January 2015, the defendants deleted certain archive files containing PII that they had previously transferred from Anthem\u2019s enterprise data warehouse.</p>\n<p>Defendant Wang is specifically alleged to have controlled two domain names connected to the criminal activity. \u00a0According to the indictment, one of these domain names was associated with a backdoor used in the intrusion victimizing Victim Business 1, and the other was associated by Wang with a server used to create an email account used to conduct spearfishing attacks against employees of Victim Business 3.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Indianapolis Field Office.\u00a0 Senior Counsel William A. Hall, Jr. of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the General Crimes Unit Steven D. DeBrota of the Southern District of Indiana are prosecuting the case.\u00a0 Significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>Charges contained in an indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

The indictment announced today represents a true international success and should serve as a message to others that the FBI will always pursue criminals victimizing Americans, no matter where they may try to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWebsites like DeepDotWeb\u00a0pose\u00a0global threats that require\u00a0global partnerships,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jones.\u00a0 \u201cDDW acted as a gateway to the Darknet, allowing for the purchase and exchange of illicit drugs and other illegal items around the world, and the individuals charged today profited from those nefarious transactions. \u00a0The efforts of federal and international law enforcement should send the message that we are coming after the operators of these dangerous websites.\u201d</p>\n<p><b><u>Summary</u></b></p>\n<p>According to the indictment, from in and around October 2013 and continuing through the date of the indictment, Tal Prihar and his co-conspirator Michael Phan allegedly owned and operated DDW, hosted at www.deepdotweb.com and also accessible on the Darknet at DeepDot35Wveyd5.onion.</p>\n<p>DDW provided users with direct access to numerous online Darknet marketplaces, not accessible through traditional search engines,\u00a0 at which vendors offered for sale illegal narcotics such as fentanyl, carfentanil, cocaine, heroin, and crystal methamphetamine, firearms, including assault rifles, malicious software and hacking tools; stolen financial information and payment cards and numbers; access device-making equipment and other illegal contraband.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prihar and Phan received kickback payments, representing commissions on the proceeds from each purchase of the illegal goods made by individuals referred to a Darknet marketplace from the DDW site.\u00a0 These kickback payments were made in virtual currency, such as bitcoin, and paid into a DDW-controlled bitcoin \u201cwallet.\u201d To conceal and disguise the nature and source of the illegal proceeds, totaling over $15 million, Prihar and Phan transferred their illegal kickback payments from their DDW bitcoin wallet to other bitcoin accounts and to bank accounts they controlled in the names of shell companies.</p>\n<p><b><u>The Money Laundering Kickback Scheme</u></b></p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Darknet marketplaces operated on the \u201cTor\u201d network, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the Internet.\u00a0 Because of Tor\u2019s structure, a user who wanted to visit a particular Darknet marketplace needed to know the site\u2019s exact .onion address. DDW simplified this process by including pages of hyperlinks to various Darknet marketplaces\u2019 .onion addresses.</p>\n<p>Further, the indictment alleges that users who visited DDW were able to click on the hyperlinks to navigate directly to the Darknet marketplaces.\u00a0 Embedded in these links were unique account identifiers, which enabled the individual marketplaces to pay what they referred to as \u201cReferral Bonuses,\u201d to DDW.\u00a0 Kickbacks in the form of referral bonuses, paid in virtual currency, were a percentage of the profits of all of the activities conducted on the marketplace by any user who made purchases on the marketplace by using DDW\u2019s customized referral link.\u00a0 Through the use of the referral links, DDW received kickbacks from Darknet marketplaces every time a purchaser used DDW to buy illegal narcotics or other illegal goods on the marketplace.</p>\n<p>During the time period relevant to this Indictment, DDW\u2019s referral links were widely used by users in the Western District of Pennsylvania and elsewhere to access and then create accounts on many Darknet marketplaces, including AlphaBay Market, Agora Market, Abraxas Market, Dream Market, Valhalla Market, Hansa Market, TradeRoute Market, Dr. D\u2019s, Wall Street Market, and Tochka Market.\u00a0 When AlphaBay was seized by law enforcement in 2017, it was one of the largest Darknet markets that offered illegal drugs, fraudulent identification materials, counterfeit goods, hacking tools, malware, firearms, and toxic chemicals.\u00a0 Approximately 23.6 percent of all orders completed on AlphaBay were associated with an account created through a DDW referral link, meaning that DDW received a referral fee for 23.6 percent of all orders made on AlphaBay.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the conspiracy, the defendants referred hundreds of thousands of users to Darknet marketplaces.\u00a0 These users in turn completed hundreds of millions\u2019 of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions, including purchases of illegal narcotics such as fentanyl, carfentanil, cocaine, heroin, and crystal methamphetamine; firearms, including assault rifles; malicious software and hacking tools; stolen financial information and payment cards and numbers; access device-making equipment; and other illegal contraband.\u00a0 Through the use of the referral links, the defendants received kickbacks worth millions of dollars, generated from the illicit sales conducted on Darknet marketplace accounts created through the site.</p>\n<p>The defendants grew and promoted the DDW site, which functioned to drive further traffic to the DDW referral links, generating additional income for the defendants.\u00a0 Prihar functioned as the administrator of DDW. He registered the domain, made infrastructure payments and maintained control over site content. \u00a0Phan was responsible for DDW\u2019s technical operations, designing and maintaining the website\u2019s day-to-day operation. Phan and Prihar communicated on a daily basis to facilitate their criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p>From in or before November 2014 until the date of this indictment, the defendants controlled a bitcoin wallet that they used to receive the kickback payments for purchases completed on the various Darknet marketplaces. \u00a0Throughout the course of the conspiracy, DDW operated accounts on Darknet markets and communicated with the operators of various Darknet markets regarding kickback payments.</p>\n<p>Between in and around November 2014 and April 10, 2019, DDW received approximately 8,155 bitcoin in kickback payments from Darknet marketplaces, worth approximately $8,414,173 when adjusted for the trading value of bitcoin at the time of each transaction.\u00a0 The bitcoin was transferred to DDW\u2019s bitcoin wallet, controlled by the defendants, in a series of more than 40,000 deposits and was subsequently withdrawn to various destinations both known and unknown to the grand jury through over 2,700 transactions.\u00a0 Due to bitcoin\u2019s fluctuating exchange rate, the value of the bitcoin at the time of the withdrawals from the DDW bitcoin wallet equated to approximately $15,489,415.\u00a0 In seeking to conceal their illicit activities and protect their criminal enterprise and the illegal proceeds it generated, the defendants set up numerous shell companies around the world.\u00a0 The defendants used these companies to move their ill-gotten gains and conduct other activity related to DDW.\u00a0 These companies included WwwCom Ltd., M&amp;T Marketing, Imtech, O.T.S.R. Biztech, and Tal Advanced Tech.</p>\n<p>An indictment contains only allegations.\u00a0 A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>This case was brought in conjunction with the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (J-CODE) Team.\u00a0 Established within the FBI\u2019s Hi-Tech Organized Crime Unit, J-CODE is a U.S. Government initiative announced in January 2018, aimed at targeting drug trafficking, especially fentanyl and other opioids, on the Darknet.\u00a0 The J-CODE team brings together agents, analysts, and professional staff with expertise in drugs, gangs, health care fraud, and more.\u00a0 J-CODE entities, including the FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Department of Defense (DOD), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and Department of Justice focus on disrupting the sale of drugs via the Darknet and dismantling criminal enterprises that facilitate this trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Lieber Smolar of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and Trial Attorneys Alexander Gottfried and Joseph Wheatley of the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section are prosecuting the case. \u00a0The FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh Field Office is investigating the case. \u00a0The Department thanks the French authorities, as well as its law enforcement colleagues at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, IRS Criminal Investigation, Brazilian Federal Police Cyber Division, Israeli National Police, Dutch National Police, Europol Darkweb Team, German Federal Criminal Police (the Bundeskriminalamt), Polizeidirektion Zwickau and Saxon Police in Germany and law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 Significant assistance was also provided by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs. The prosecution and investigative team thanks the AlphaBay prosecution team and the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section for their assistance.</p></div>",

Cullen announced today that the ARPO Strike Force will expand into the Western District of Virginia, making it the tenth ARPO Strike Force district.\u00a0 ARPO is a joint law enforcement effort that brings together the resources and expertise of the Health Care Fraud Unit in the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section (HCF Unit), the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for ten federal districts in six states, as well as law enforcement partners at the FBI, HHS Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\u00a0 In addition, the operation includes the participation of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, multiple State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and other federal and state agencies.\u00a0 The mission of the ARPO Strike Force is to identify and investigate health care fraud schemes in the Appalachian region and surrounding areas, and to effectively and efficiently prosecute medical professionals and others involved in the illegal prescription and distribution of opioids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges announced today involve individuals contributing to the opioid epidemic, with a particular focus on medical professionals involved in the unlawful distribution of opioids and other prescription narcotics, a priority for the Department.\u00a0 According to the CDC, approximately 130 Americans die every day of an opioid overdose.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s takedown demonstrates the FBI\u2019s unwavering commitment to working alongside our Strike Force partners, including the HHS-OIG and DEA, to fight the opioid epidemic and related criminal activity in the Appalachian region,\u201d said FBI Executive Assistant Director Hess. \u201cWe will not stand by and allow the harmful and oftentimes deadly practice of over-prescribing highly addictive drugs to continue unchecked. The FBI will pursue medical personnel who misuse their positions of trust to blatantly disregard others\u2019 very lives for their own financial gain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe opioid crisis has had a devastating impact in the Appalachian region,\u201d said Principal Deputy Inspector General Chiedi. \u201cAddressing this public health issue and ensuring beneficiaries have continuity of care requires a collaborative approach with our federal, state, and local partners. Our commitment is resolute. We will continue working together to protect the health and well-being of all Americans and ending this terrible epidemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOpioid misuse and abuse is an insidious epidemic, created in large part, by the over-prescribing of potent opioids nationwide, and unfortunately, Appalachia\u00a0is at the center,\u201d\u00a0said DEA Assistant Administrator Martin.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear message that investigations involving diversion of prescription drugs\u00a0have\u00a0been, and\u00a0continue\u00a0to be, a priority for DEA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCMS CPI\u00a0is proud to work very closely everyday with our law enforcement partners to stop the exploitation of vulnerable patients and misuse of taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Deputy Administrator and Director of Center for Program Integrity Alexander. \u201cNowhere is this collaboration more important than in our fight against the opioid crisis in America. This is one of the President\u2019s highest priorities and we are proud to be an important part of the largest prescription opioid enforcement effort ever undertaken. We will continue to work tirelessly through investigation, data coordination and administrative action to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ARPO Strike Force is made up of prosecutors and data analysts with the HCF Unit, prosecutors with the 10 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices in the region, including the newly added Western District of Virginia, and special agents with the FBI, HHS-OIG and DEA.\u00a0 The ARPO Strike Force operates out of two hubs based in the Cincinnati, Ohio/Northern Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee, areas, supporting the 10 districts that make up the ARPO Strike Force region.\u00a0 In addition, the APRO Strike Force works closely with other state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>*********<b>\u00a0</b></b></p>\n<p>For the ARPO Strike force locations, in the Southern District of Ohio, six individuals, including two doctors and three registered pharmacists were charged with several counts, including unlawful distribution of controlled substances and conspiracy to obtain controlled substances by fraud.\u00a0 In one case, a doctor who is alleged to have been at one time the highest prescriber of controlled substances in the state, and several pharmacists are charged with operating an alleged \u201cpill mill\u201d in Dayton, Ohio.\u00a0 According to the indictment, between October 2015 and October 2017 alone, the pharmacy allegedly dispensed over 1.75 million pills.\u00a0 These cases were brought with assistance from the FBI, DEA, and HHS-OIG, as well as the Ohio Attorney General's Office, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation Ohio; the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the Ohio Medical Board.</p>\n<p>In the Western District of Kentucky, a doctor was charged with controlled substance and health care fraud counts in connection with providing pre-signed, blank prescriptions to office staff who then used them to prescribe controlled substances when he was out of the office, and for directing staff at the clinic, including individuals not licensed to practice medicine, to perform medical services on patients.\u00a0 In another case, a doctor, a Florida compounding pharmacy and its owner were charged in connection with a scheme that involved the payment of alleged kickbacks in return for writing prescriptions for compounded drugs that included controlled substances, and for fraudulently inflating the costs for prescriptions that were billed for reimbursement by Medicare and TRICARE.\u00a0 These cases were brought with assistance from the FBI, DEA, HHS-OIG, and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, as well as the Kentucky State Police, the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department, the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, the Kentucky Department of Insurance, and the Kentucky Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.</p>\n<p>In the Eastern District of Kentucky, a total of five people were charged, including three doctors, a dentist and an office assistant who were charged in connection with several health care fraud and/or controlled substance schemes.\u00a0 In one case a doctor operating a clinic that focused on pain management allegedly provided pre-signed, blank prescriptions to office staff who then used them to prescribe controlled substances when he was out of the office.\u00a0 In another case, a solo practitioner who operates a five-clinic family practice focusing on pain management allegedly billed Medicare for urine testing that was not done and for urine testing that was not medically necessary.\u00a0 A dentist was charged for alleged conduct that included writing prescriptions for opioids that had no legitimate medical purpose and that were outside the usual course of professional practice, removing teeth unnecessarily, scheduling unnecessary follow-up appointments, and billing inappropriately for services.\u00a0 In yet another case, a doctor was charged for allegedly prescribing opioids to Facebook friends who would come to his home to pick up prescriptions, and for signing prescriptions for other persons based on messenger requests to his office manager, who then allegedly delivered the signed prescriptions in exchange for cash.

This particular fake account caused several of Witt\u2019s former colleagues to accept \u201cfriend\u201d requests.</p>\n<p><strong>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *</strong></p>\n<p>The case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office with assistance from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\u00a0 The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Deborah Curtis, Jocelyn Ballantine and Luke Jones of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia with assistance from Trial Attorney Evan N.

Vlad-C\u0103lin Nistor, 31, of Romania, and Rossen Iossifov, 51, of Bulgaria. \u00a0On Feb. 6, a federal grand jury in Lexington returned an 11-count indictment charging an additional foreign national and four Americans for their roles in the criminal enterprise. \u00a0Those charged include Beniamin-Filip Ologeanu, 29, of Alexandria, Romania; Austin Edward Nedved, 27, of Northborough, Massachusetts; Dimitrious Antoine Brown, 37, of Macon, Georgia and Rashawd Lamar Tulloch, 30, of Newnan, Georgia.\u00a0 Andrew Gilbert Ybarra II, 25, of Patterson, California, was also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. \u00a0In all, 15 Romanian nationals and one Bulgarian national were charged in these two indictments.\u00a0 Of these, 12 have been extradited to the United States and are awaiting trials, which are currently set for June 18, 2019 and Aug. 7, 2019.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that these defendants participated in a criminal conspiracy primarily located in Alexandria, Romania that engaged in a large-scale scheme of online auction fraud. \u00a0Specifically, Romania-based members of the conspiracy and their associates posted false advertisements to popular online auction and sales websites\u2014such as Craigslist and eBay\u2014for high-cost goods (typically vehicles) that did not actually exist.\u00a0 According to the indictment, these members would convince American victims to send money for the advertised goods by crafting persuasive narratives, for example, by impersonating a military member who needed to sell the advertised item before deployment. \u00a0The members of the conspiracy are alleged to have created fictitious online accounts to post these advertisements and communicate with victims, often using the stolen identities of Americans to do so.\u00a0 They are alleged to have delivered invoices to the victims bearing trademarks of reputable companies in order to make the transactions appear legitimate.\u00a0 Once victims were convinced to send payment, the indictment alleges that the conspiracy engaged in a complicated money laundering scheme wherein domestic associates would accept victim funds, convert these funds to cryptocurrency, and transfer proceeds in the form of cryptocurrency to foreign-based associates. \u00a0The indictment alleges that these foreign-based money launderers include Vlad-C\u0103lin Nistor, who owns Coinflux Services SRL, and Rossen Iossifov, who owns R G Coins. \u00a0According to the indictment, Nistor and Iossifov exchanged cryptocurrency into local fiat currency on behalf of the Romania-based members of the conspiracy, knowing that they were exchanging bitcoin that represented the proceeds of fraud.</p>\n<p>Some of the fraud schemes alleged in the indictments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nedelcu persuaded victims to send money for the advertised goods by creating fictitious but legitimate sounding entities through which he purported to sell vehicles.\u00a0 For example, he used email address, foiaol2015@gmail.com, belonging to Aol Autos, to communicate with victims by email with subject lines like, \u201cAmerica Online Autos Financial Department [Order # 099106592090].\u201d\u00a0 The email would contain messages appearing to be legitimate invoices for payment for the advertised item purported to be sold.</li>\n<li>Ciobanu and his coconspirators used the email address judithlane82@gmail.com to communicate with victims about the sale of vehicles, signing the emails as \u201cSgt. Judith Lane,\u201d and created a Facebook profile for Judith Lane, who was depicted as a member of the Air Force. Ciobanu, acting as \u201cJudith Lane,\u201d also posted two Facebook advertisements for the sale of automobiles.</li>\n<li>Cernat and his coconspirators sent victims invoices that appeared to be from eBay Motors and provided an eBay Motors Support Department phone number and email address of ebay@processing-secure.com.\u00a0 These invoices provided instructions for payment and included reassuring language for secure transactions, such as, \u201cThrough OneVanilla Prepaid Visa services we can guarantee you 100 percent protection and insurance in this transaction.\u00a0 eBay Payments will secure the payment until the buyer receives, inspects, and accepts the item.\u00a0 Or, if it will be the case, eBay will refund the payment to the buyer.\u201d</li>\n<li>P\u0103iu\u015fi also convinced victims to send money for the advertised goods by sending them invoices for payment that appeared legitimate. \u2026 [One such] invoice appeared to be sent from \u201ceBay<sup>TM </sup>Buyer Protection,\u201d provided the victim with an email address for questions, described the seller as a \u201ccertified eBay<sup>TM\u00a0 </sup>third-party seller,\u201d and explained that the buyer will be refunded if he or she refuses the merchandise.</li>\n<li>The coconspirators then communicated with the victims via email, often signing their emails by posing as a member of the military, like \u201cSgt. Logan Burdick.\u201d\u00a0 Other emails purported to be from the online auction company, like eBay.\u00a0 The emails often communicated convincing information about the item being sold and the reason payment was required before shipping or viewing the item.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adrian Mitan, who was charged in the July 5, 2018 indictment, was also charged in a separate indictment unsealed today with money laundering offenses arising from a credit card phishing and brute-force attack scheme, likewise designed to steal money from Americans. \u00a0The indictment explains that phishing is an attempt to acquire personal information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity through electronic communications, and brute force is a cryptological trial-and-error methodology used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers for credit cards. \u00a0Mitan allegedly phished for credit/debit card information of U.S. customers, hacked into the electronic systems of American businesses, and then conducted a brute force attack on their point-of-sale systems for the purpose of stealing the remaining credit/debit card information.\u00a0 According to the indictment, Mitan then directed American money launderers to create \u201cdummy\u201d credit/debit cards with the stolen information, which were used to extract money from the customers\u2019 accounts.\u00a0 These fraudulent proceeds were then returned to Mitan in the form of bitcoin.</p>\n<p>The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Secret Service, Kentucky State Police, Lexington Police Department, IRS Criminal Investigation and U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and supported by the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2).\u00a0 Assistance was provided by the Romanian National Police (Service for Combating Cybercrime) and the Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (Agency for Prosecuting Organized Crime).\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant support with the defendants\u2019 extradition.\u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kathryn M. Anderson and Kenneth R. Taylor of the Eastern District of Kentucky and Senior Trial Attorney Timothy Flowers and Senior Counsel Frank Lin of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section with assistance from the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Individuals believing they may be victims of the advanced fee and online auction fraud or brute-force attack schemes described herein are encouraged to visit the following website to obtain more information: <a href=\"https://justice.gov/usao-edky/information-victims-large-cases\">https://justice.gov/usao-edky/information-victims-large-cases</a>.\u00a0 Tips to avoid becoming a victim of online auction fraud can be found <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/data/press/releases/2019/19-FEB/Online_Auction_Fraud_Tips_to_Avoid_Becoming_a_Victim.pdf\">here</a> on the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s website.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the RICO conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy charges, each defendant faces up to 20 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, and three years of supervised release. \u00a0The same penalties apply to the money laundering conspiracy charges, except that the fine may be up to $500,000.\u00a0 Additionally, if convicted of identity theft, Brown faces a term of 15 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, and three years of supervised release, and if convicted of aggravated identity theft, those charged face a mandatory-minimum sentence of two years in prison, to be served consecutive to any term of imprisonment ordered for the other counts of conviction. \u00a0However, any sentence following a conviction would be imposed by the Court, after its consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statutes.</p>\n<p>The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

The defendants and others then profited by selling access to the confidential information in these reports and trading on this stolen information prior to its distribution to the investing public.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants allegedly orchestrated sophisticated computer intrusions to steal non-public information from the SEC, compromising the integrity of the market and depriving honest investors of a level playing field,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThe Department of Justice will aggressively pursue and prosecute those who attack our financial markets and seek to profit unfairly, no matter where such offenders reside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants charged in the indictment announced today engaged in a sophisticated hacking and insider trading scheme to cheat the securities markets and the investing public,\u201d U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said. \u201cThey targeted the Securities and Exchange Commission with a series of sophisticated and relentless cyber-attacks, stealing thousands of confidential EDGAR filings from the Commission\u2019s servers and then trading on the inside information in those filings before it was known to the market, all at the expense of the average investor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment sends a strong message to those criminals who choose to use the cyber-world to profit from network intrusion,\u201d Mark McKevitt, Special Agent in Charge of the Secret Service Newark Field Office, said.\u00a0\u201cThe Secret Service will continue to aggressively investigate cyber-enabled financial crimes and develop innovative ways to combat emerging cyber threats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThis\u00a0indictment is a testament to the countless hours of hard work and dedication by law enforcement in the fight against cyber criminals,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie said.\u00a0 \u201cCybercrime knows no boundaries. Dismantling these operations are possible only by working closely with our partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictments unsealed today:</p>\n<p>From February 2016 to March 2017, Radchenko, Ieremenko, and others conspired to gain unauthorized access to the computer networks of the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system, which is used by publicly traded companies to file required disclosures, such as annual and quarterly earnings reports. These filings contained detailed information about the financial condition and operations of the companies, including their earnings. Such information can, and often does, affect the stock price of the companies when it is made public, and is therefore highly confidential prior to its disclosure to the general public.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The EDGAR system allows companies to make test filings in advance of a public filing. These test filings often contain information that is the same as, or similar to the information in the final filing. The defendants stole thousands of test filings before they were released to the public, and sought to profit from their theft by using the information in the test filings to trade before the investing public learned the information.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To gain access to the SEC\u2019s computer networks, the defendants used a series of targeted cyber-attacks, including directory traversal attacks, phishing attacks, and infecting computers with malware. Once the defendants had access to the test filings on the EDGAR system, they stole them by copying the test filings to servers they controlled. For example, between May 2016 and October 2016, the defendants extracted thousands of test filings from the EDGAR servers to a server they controlled in Lithuania.</p>\n<p>Ieremenko was previously charged in a hacking and securities fraud scheme in an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/nine-people-charged-largest-known-computer-hacking-and-securities-fraud-scheme%20%20\">indictment</a> in the District of New Jersey. That indictment charged Ieremenko with being part of a large-scale, international conspiracy to hack the computer systems of three newswire organizations and steal press releases containing confidential non-public financial information relating to hundreds of companies traded on the NASDAQ and NYSE from three newswires. The members of the conspiracy profited from the theft by trading on the news ahead of its distribution to the investing public. The indictment unsealed today alleges Ieremenko employed some of the same methods to hack the SEC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Radchenko recruited to the scheme traders who were provided with the stolen test filings so they could profit by trading on the information before the investing public. Armed with the stolen information, the traders profited by executing various trades in brokerage accounts they controlled. In one instance, a test filing for \u201cPublic Company 1\u201d was uploaded to the EDGAR servers at 3:32 p.m. (EDT) on May 19, 2016. Six minutes later, the defendants stole the test filing and uploaded a copy to the Lithuania server. Between 3:42 p.m. and 3:59 p.m., a conspirator purchased approximately $2.4 million worth of shares of Public Company 1. At 4:02 p.m., Public Company 1 released its second quarter earnings report and announced that it expected to deliver record earnings in 2016. Over the next day, the conspirator sold all the acquired shares in Public Company 1 for a profit of more than $270,000.</p>\n<p>The wire fraud conspiracy and substantive wire fraud counts with which the defendants are charged carry a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense. The securities fraud conspiracy, computer fraud conspiracy, and substantive computer fraud counts with which the defendants are charged carry a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the U.S. States Secret Service and special agents of the FBI, with assistance from the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse and Cyber Units and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The prosecution is being handled by Trial Attorney Aarash Haghighat of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), and by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Shapiro; Chief of the Cybercrimes Unit Justin S. Herring; Attorney-in-Charge, of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Trenton Nicholas Grippo; and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Lynn O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p>The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p></div>",

Rosenstein, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York, Director Christopher A. Wray of the FBI, Director Dermot F. O\u2019Reilly of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) of the U.S. Department of Defense, and Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.</p>\n<p>Zhu and Zhang were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cyber security community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (the APT10 Group).\u00a0 The defendants worked for a company in China called Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company (Huaying Haitai) and acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security\u2019s Tianjin State Security Bureau.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through their involvement with the APT10 Group, from at least in or about 2006 up to and including in or about 2018, Zhu and Zhang conducted global campaigns of computer intrusions targeting, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business and technological information at managed service providers (MSPs), which are companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world, more than 45 technology companies in at least a dozen U.S. states, and U.S. government agencies.\u00a0 The APT10 Group targeted a diverse array of commercial activity, industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production.\u00a0 Among other things, Zhu and Zhang registered IT infrastructure that the APT10 Group used for its intrusions and engaged in illegal hacking operations.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment alleges that the defendants were part of a group that hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and gave China\u2019s intelligence service access to sensitive business information,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u00a0 \u201cThis is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is galling that American companies and government agencies spent years of research and countless dollars to develop their intellectual property, while the defendants simply stole it and got it for free\u201d said U.S. Attorney Berman.\u00a0 \u201cAs a nation, we cannot, and will not, allow such brazen thievery to go unchecked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealthy competition is good for the global economy, but criminal conduct is not.\u00a0 This is conduct that hurts American businesses, American jobs, and American consumers,\u201d said FBI Director Wray.\u00a0 \u201cNo country should be able to flout the rule of law \u2013 so we\u2019re going to keep calling out this behavior for what it is: illegal, unethical, and unfair.\u00a0 It's going to take all of us working together to protect our economic security and our way of life, because the American people deserve no less.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cThe theft of sensitive defense technology and cyber intrusions are major national security concerns and top investigative priorities for the DCIS,\u201d said DCIS Director O\u2019Reilly.\u00a0 \u201cThe indictments unsealed today are the direct result of a joint investigative effort between DCIS and its law enforcement partners to vigorously investigate individuals and groups who illegally access information technology systems of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Industrial Base.\u00a0 DCIS remains vigilant in our efforts to safeguard the integrity of the Department of Defense and its enterprise of information technology systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:</p>\n<p><em><u>Overview</u></em></p>\n<p>Zhu Hua (\u6731\u534e), aka Afwar, aka CVNX, aka Alayos, aka Godkiller, and Zhang Shilong (\u5f20\u58eb\u9f99), aka Baobeilong, aka Zhang Jianguo, aka Atreexp, the defendants, both nationals of China, were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cyber security community as the APT10 Group, or alternatively as \u201cRed Apollo,\u201d \u201cCVNX,\u201d \u201cStone Panda,\u201d \u201cMenuPass,\u201d and \u201cPOTASSIUM.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants worked for Huaying Haitai in Tianjin, China, and acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security\u2019s Tianjin State Security Bureau.\u00a0 From at least in or about 2006 up to and including in or about 2018, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, conducted extensive campaigns of intrusions into computer systems around the world.\u00a0 The APT10 Group used some of the same online facilities to initiate, facilitate and execute its campaigns during the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Most recently, beginning at least in or about 2014, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, engaged in an intrusion campaign to obtain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of MSPs for businesses and governments around the world (the MSP Theft Campaign).\u00a0 The APT10 Group targeted MSPs in order to leverage the MSPs\u2019 networks to gain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of the MSPs\u2019 clients and to steal, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business data on a global scale.\u00a0 For example, through the MSP Theft Campaign, the APT10 Group obtained unauthorized access to the computers of an MSP that had offices in the Southern District of New York and compromised the data of that MSP and certain of its clients involved in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining.</p>\n<p>Earlier, beginning in or about 2006, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, engaged in an intrusion campaign to obtain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of more than 45 technology companies and U.S. government agencies, in order to steal information and data concerning a number of technologies (the Technology Theft Campaign).\u00a0 Through the Technology Theft Campaign, the APT10 Group stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and targeted the computers of victim companies involved in aviation, space and satellite technology, manufacturing technology, pharmaceutical technology, oil and gas exploration and production technology, communications technology, computer processor technology, and maritime technology.</p>\n<p>In furtherance of the APT10 Group\u2019s intrusion campaigns, Zhu and Zhang, among other things, worked for Huaying Haitai and registered malicious domains and infrastructure.\u00a0 In addition, Zhu, a penetration tester, engaged in hacking operations on behalf of the APT10 Group and recruited other individuals to the APT10 Group, and Zhang developed and tested malware for the APT10 Group.</p>\n<p><em><u>The MSP Theft Campaign</u></em></p>\n<p>In furtherance of the MSP Theft Campaign, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators in the APT10 Group engaged in the following criminal conduct:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, after the APT10 Group gained unauthorized access into the computers of an MSP, the APT10 Group installed multiple variants of malware on MSP computers around the world. To avoid antivirus detection, the malware was installed using malicious files that masqueraded as legitimate files associated with the victim computer\u2019s operating system.\u00a0 Such malware enabled members of the APT10 Group to monitor victims\u2019 computers remotely and steal user credentials.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Second, after stealing administrative credentials from computers of an MSP, the APT10 Group used those stolen credentials to connect to other systems within an MSP and its clients\u2019 networks. This enabled the APT10 Group to move laterally through an MSP\u2019s network and its clients\u2019 networks and to compromise victim computers that were not yet infected with malware.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Third, after identifying data of interest on a compromised computer and packaging it for exfiltration using encrypted archives, the APT10 Group used stolen credentials to move the data of an MSP client to one or more other compromised computers of the MSP or its other clients\u2019 networks before exfiltrating the data to other computers controlled by the APT10 Group.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the course of the MSP Theft Campaign, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators in the APT10 Group successfully obtained unauthorized access to computers providing services to or belonging to victim companies located in at least 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\u00a0 The victim companies included at least the following:\u00a0 a global financial institution, three telecommunications and/or consumer electronics companies; three companies involved in commercial or industrial manufacturing; two consulting companies; a healthcare company; a biotechnology company; a mining company; an automotive supplier company; and a drilling company.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><u>The Technology Theft Campaign</u></em></p>\n<p>Over the course of the Technology Theft Campaign, which began in or about 2006, Zhu, Zhang, and their coconspirators in the APT10 Group successfully obtained unauthorized access to the computers of more than 45 technology companies and U.S. Government agencies based in at least 12 states, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.\u00a0 The APT10 Group stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and information from the victims\u2019 computer systems, including from at least the following victims: seven companies involved in aviation, space and/or satellite technology; three companies involved in communications technology; three companies involved in manufacturing advanced electronic systems and/or laboratory analytical instruments; a company involved in maritime technology; a company involved in oil and gas drilling, production, and processing; and the NASA Goddard Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\u00a0 In addition to those victims who had information stolen, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators successfully obtained unauthorized access to computers belonging to more than 25 other technology-related companies involved in, among other things, industrial factory automation, radar technology, oil exploration, information technology services, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and computer processor technology, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, the APT10 Group compromised more than 40 computers in order to steal sensitive data belonging to the Navy, including the names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, salary information, personal phone numbers, and email addresses of more than 100,000 Navy personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *</strong></p>\n<p>Zhu and Zhang are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\u00a0 The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>\n<p>The case was investigated by the FBI, including the New Orleans, New Haven, Houston, New York, Sacramento, and San Antonio Field Offices; DCIS; and the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).\u00a0 Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Berman and Mr. Demers praised the outstanding investigative work of, and collaboration among, the FBI, DCIS, and NCIS.\u00a0 They also thanked the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut, and the Department of Defense\u2019s Computer Forensic Laboratory for their assistance in the investigation.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Sagar K. Ravi of the Southern District of New York\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit is in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p></div>",

Booter services such as those named in this action allegedly cause attacks on a wide array of victims in the United States and abroad, including financial institutions, universities, internet service providers, government systems, and various gaming platforms.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Nicola T. Hanna of the Central District of California, U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder of the District of Alaska, and Assistant Director Matthew Gorham of the FBI Cyber Division made the announcement. \u00a0The action against the DDoS services comes the week before the Christmas holiday, a period historically plagued by prolific DDoS attacks in the gaming world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Dec. 19, pursuant to seizure warrants issued by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the FBI seized the domains of 15 booter services, which represent some of the world\u2019s leading DDoS-for-hire services. \u00a0Among these sites were critical-boot.com, ragebooter.com, downthem.org and quantumstress.net.</p>\n<p>According to the affidavit in support of the warrant authorizing the seizure of the 15 websites, these services offered easy access to attack infrastructure, payment options that included Bitcoin, and were relatively low cost.\u00a0 Each of the services was tested by the FBI, which verified those DDoS\u00a0attack services offered through each of the seized websites.\u00a0 While testing the various services, the FBI determined that these types of services can and have caused disruptions of networks at all levels.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the seizure warrants, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California on Dec. 19 charged Matthew Gatrel, 30, of St. Charles, Illinois, and Juan Martinez, 25, of Pasadena, California, with conspiring to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act through the operation of services known as Downthem and Ampnode. \u00a0According to the criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles, Downthem offered DDoS services directly to users who wished to attack other internet users, and Ampnode offered resources designed to facilitate the creation of standalone DDoS services by customers.\u00a0 Between October 2014 and November 2018, Downthem\u2019s database showed over 2000 customer subscriptions, and had been used to conduct, or attempt to conduct, over 200,000 DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 12, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Alaska charged David Bukoski, 23, of Hanover Township, Pennsylvania, with aiding and abetting computer intrusions.\u00a0\u00a0 The charging documents allege that Bukoski operated Quantum Stresser, one of the longest-running DDoS services in operation.\u00a0 As of Nov. 29, Quantum had over 80,000 customer subscriptions dating back to its launch in 2012.\u00a0 In 2018 alone, Quantum was used to launch over 50,000 actual or attempted DDoS attacks targeting victims worldwide, including victims in Alaska and California.</p>\n<p>\u201cDDoS attacks are serious crimes that can cause real harm, as shown by the wide range of sectors allegedly victimized in this case,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThe operators and the customers of DDoS-for-hire services should be on notice that the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute those who perpetrate malicious cyber attacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDDoS for hire services such as these pose a significant national threat,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Schroder.\u00a0 \u201cCoordinated investigations and prosecutions such as these demonstrate the importance of cross-District collaboration and coordination with public sector partners.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe attack-for-hire websites targeted in this investigation offered customers the ability to disrupt computer networks on a massive scale, undermining the internet infrastructure on which we all rely,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hanna. \u00a0\u201cWhile this week\u2019s crackdown will have a significant impact on this burgeoning criminal industry, there are other sites offering these services \u2013 and we will continue our efforts to rid the internet of these websites. \u00a0We are committed to seeing the internet remain a forum for the free and unfettered exchange of information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhether you launch the DDoS attack or hire a DDoS service to do it for you, the FBI considers it criminal activity,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director Gorham.\u00a0 \u201cWorking with our industry and law enforcement partners, the FBI will identify and potentially prosecute you for this activity.\u00a0 We will use every tool at our disposal to combat all forms of cybercrime including DDoS activity.\u00a0 We encourage all DDoS victims to contact your local FBI field office or file a complaint with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at <a href=\"http://www.ic3.gov\">www.ic3.gov</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, booter and stresser services have grown as an increasingly prevalent class of DDoS attack tools.\u00a0 These types of DDoS attacks are so named because they result in the \u201cbooting\u201d or dropping of the victim-targeted website from the internet.\u00a0 Booter-based DDoS attack tools offer a low barrier to entry for users looking to engage in cyber criminal activity, representing an effective advance in internet attack technology.</p>\n<p>For additional information on booter and stresser services and the harm that they cause, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/media/2017/171017-2.aspx\">https://www.ic3.gov/media/2017/171017-2.aspx</a>.</p>\n<p>The charges in the indictment and criminal complaint are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The cases announced today are being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Anchorage Field Office and the FBI\u2019s Cyber Initiative and Resource Fusion Unit (CIRFU). \u00a0Additional assistance was provided by the FBI\u2019s Chicago, Los

With integrity and professionalism, the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute such illegal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe theft of intellectual property is not only unfair, but stifles technological innovation by disincentivizing investment in long-term research and development,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Alex Tse.\u00a0 \u201cThe theft of intellectual property on a continuing basis by nation-state actors is an even more damaging affront to the rule of law.

(\u201cJinhua'\u201d), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a.

Demers, United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Scott W. Brady, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Cyber Division, Eric Welling, and Director General Mark Flynn for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"State-sponsored hacking and disinformation campaigns pose serious threats to our security and to our open society, but the Department of Justice is defending against them,\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. \"Today we are indicting seven GRU officers for multiple felonies each, including the use of hacking to spread the personal information of hundreds of anti-doping officials and athletes as part of an effort to distract from Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. The defendants in this case allegedly targeted multiple Americans and American entities for hacking, from our national anti-doping agency to the Westinghouse Electric Company near Pittsburgh. We are determined to achieve justice in these cases and we will continue to protect the American people from hackers and disinformation.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe investigation leading to the indictments announced\u00a0<a href=\"https://admin.govdelivery.com/abe/bulletins/1632216/%20%20\">t</a>oday\u00a0is the FBI at its best,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe actions of these seven hackers, all working as officials for the Russian government, were criminal, retaliatory, and damaging to innocent victims and the United States\u2019 economy, as well as to world organizations. Their actions extended beyond borders, but so did the FBI\u2019s investigation. We worked closely with our international partners to identify the actors and disrupt their criminal campaign - and\u00a0today, we are sending this message: The FBI will not permit any government, group, or individual to threaten our people, our country, or our partners. We will work tirelessly to find them, stop them, and bring them to justice.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cWe want the hundreds of victims of these Russian hackers to know that we will do everything we can to hold these criminals accountable for their crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Brady.\u00a0 State actors who target U.S. citizens and companies are no different than any other common criminal:\u00a0 they will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThe defendants, all Russian nationals and residents, are Aleksei Sergeyevich Morenets, 41, Evgenii Mikhaylovich, Serebriakov, 37, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, 32, Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, 30, and Dmitriy Sergeyevich Badin, 27, who were each assigned to Military Unit 26165, and Oleg Mikhaylovich Sotnikov, 46, and Alexey Valerevich Minin, 46, who were also GRU officers.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe indictment alleges that defendants Yermakov, Malyshev, Badin, and unidentified conspirators, often using fictitious personas and proxy servers, researched victims, sent spearphishing emails, and compiled, used, and monitored malware command and control servers.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the conspirators\u2019 remote hacking efforts failed to capture log-in credentials, or if the accounts that were successfully compromised did not have the necessary access privileges for the sought-after information, teams of GRU technical intelligence officers, including Morenets, Serebriakov, Sotnikov, and Minin, traveled to locations around the world where targets were physically located.\u00a0 Using specialized equipment, and with the remote support of conspirators in Russia, including Yermakov, these close access teams hacked computer networks used by victim organizations or their personnel through Wi-Fi connections, including hotel Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0 After a successful hacking operation, the close access team transferred such access to conspirators in Russia for exploitation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong other instances, the indictment alleges that following a series of high-profile independent investigations starting in 2015, which publicly exposed Russia\u2019s systematic state-sponsored subversion of the drug testing processes prior to, during, and subsequent to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics (according to one report, known as the \u201cMcLaren Report\u201d), the conspirators began targeting systems used by international anti-doping organizations and officials.\u00a0 After compromising those systems, the defendants stole credentials, medical records, and other data, including information regarding therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which allow athletes to use otherwise prohibited substances.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing social media accounts and other infrastructure acquired and maintained by GRU Unit 74455 in Russia, the conspiracy thereafter publicly released selected items of stolen information, in many cases in a manner that did not accurately reflect their original form, under the false auspices of a hacktivist group calling itself the \u201cFancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team.\u201d\u00a0 As part of its influence and disinformation efforts, the Fancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team engaged in a concerted effort to draw media attention to the leaks through a proactive outreach campaign.\u00a0 The conspirators exchanged e-mails and private messages with approximately 186 reporters in an apparent attempt to amplify the exposure and effect of their message.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.\u00a0 Defendants Morenets, Serebriakov, Yermakov, Malyshev, and Badin are each also charged with two counts of aggravated identity theft, which carries a consecutive sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0 Defendant Yermakov is also charged with five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefendants Yermakov, Malyshev, and Badin are also charged defendants in federal indictment number CR 18-215 in the District of Columbia, and accused of conspiring to gain unauthorized access into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the indictment:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Context of the Hacking and Related Influence and Disinformation Efforts</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn July 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s (WADA) Independent Person Report (the \u201cFirst McLaren Report\u201d) was released, describing Russia\u2019s systematic state-sponsored subversion of the drug testing process prior to, during, and subsequent to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\u00a0 This investigation had the support of advocates for clean sports, including the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES, Canada\u2019s anti-doping agency). Eventually, in some instances only after arbitration rulings by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS/CAS), approximately 111 Russian athletes were excluded from the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by a number of international athletics federations, including track-and-field\u2019s International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\u00a0 The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) further imposed a blanket ban of Russian athletes from the 2016 Paralympic Games, which were also held in Rio.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Intrusion Activities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDays after the release of the First McLaren Report and the International Olympic Committee\u2019s and IPC\u2019s subsequent decisions regarding the exclusion of\u00a0 Russian athletes, the conspirators prepared to hack into the networks of WADA, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), and TAS/CAS.\u00a0 \u00a0The conspirators, including specifically defendants Yermakov and Malyshev, procured spoofed domains (which mimicked legitimate WADA and TAS/CAS domains) and other infrastructure, probed such entities\u2019 networks, and spearphished WADA and USADA employees.\u00a0 Although Yermakov and Malyshev are both alleged to have prepared to send spearphishing e-mails to TAS/CAS, the indictment does not allege that organization was compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikely as a result of the conspirators\u2019 failure to capture necessary log-in credentials, or because those victim accounts that were successfully compromised did not have the necessary access privileges for the sought-after information, defendants Morenets and Serebriakov, in at least one instance with the remote support of Yermakov, deployed to Rio to conduct hacking operations targeting and maintaining persistent access to Wi-Fi networks used by anti-doping officials.\u00a0 As a result of these efforts, in August 2016, the conspirators captured that IOC official\u2019s credentials and thereafter used them, and another set of credentials belonging to the same official to gain unauthorized access to an account in WADA\u2019s ADAMS database and medical and anti-doping related information contained therein. (The broader ADAMS database was not compromised in the intrusion.)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in 2016, a senior USADA anti-doping official traveled to Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics and Paralympic games.\u00a0 While there, the USADA official used Wi-Fi at the hotel and other Wi-Fi access points in Rio to remotely access USADA\u2019s computer systems and conduct official business.\u00a0 While the USADA official was in Rio, conspirators successfully compromised the credentials for his or her USADA email account, which included summaries of athlete test results and prescribed medications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Intrusion Activities in Lausanne, Switzerland</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn mid-September 2016, WADA hosted an anti-doping conference in Lausanne, Switzerland.\u00a0 On September 18, 2016, defendants Morenets and Serebriakov traveled to Lausanne with equipment used in close access Wi-Fi compromises.\u00a0 On or about September 19, 2016, Morenets and Serebriakov compromised the Wi-Fi network of a hotel hosting the conference and leveraged that access to compromise the laptop and credentials of a senior CCES official staying at the hotel. Other conspirators thereafter used the stolen credentials to compromise CCES\u2019s networks in Canada, using a tool used to extract hashed passwords, the metadata of which indicated it was compiled by Badin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Intrusion Targeting Anti-Doping Officials at Sporting Federations</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn December 2016 and January 2017, conspirators successfully compromised the networks of IAAF and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\u201cFIFA\u201d) and targeted computers and accounts used by each organization\u2019s top anti-doping official.\u00a0 Among the data stolen from such officials were keylogs, file directories, anti-doping policies and strategies, lab results, medical reports, contracts with doctors and medical testing labs, information about medical testing procedures, and TUEs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Related GRU Influence and Disinformation Operations</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOn September 12, 2016, shortly after the compromise of the IOC official\u2019s ADAMS credentials, but before the compromise of USADA\u2019s and CCES\u2019s networks, conspirators claiming to be the hacktivist group Fancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team used online accounts and other infrastructure procured and managed by Unit 74455, as well as the website fancybears.net, to publicly release TUEs, other medical information, and emails stolen from anti-doping officials at WADA, USADA, CCES, IAAF, FIFA, and approximately 35 other anti-doping agencies or sporting organizations.\u00a0 In some instances, the WADA documents were modified from their original form.\u00a0 Ultimately, the Fancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team released stolen information that included private or medical information of approximately 250 athletes from almost 30 countries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conspirators\u2019 release of the stolen information was, in some instances, accompanied by posts and other communications that parroted or supported themes that the Russian government had used in its official narrative regarding the anti-doping agencies\u2019 investigative findings.\u00a0 From 2016 through 2018, the conspirators engaged in a proactive outreach campaign, using Twitter and e-mail to communicate with approximately 186 reporters about the stolen information.\u00a0 After articles were published, conspirators used the Fancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team social media accounts to draw attention to the articles in an attempt to amplify the exposure and effect of their message.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Other Targets of the Conspiracy</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe conspiracy is also alleged to have targeted other entities in the Western District of Pennsylvania and abroad that were of interest to the Russian government.\u00a0 For example, as early as November 20, 2014, Yermakov performed reconnaissance of Westinghouse Electric Company\u2019s (WEC) networks and personnel.\u00a0 In the following months, Yermakov and conspirators created a fake WEC domain and sent spearphishing emails to WEC employees\u2019 work and personal email accounts, which were designed to harvest the employees\u2019 log-in credentials.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently, in April 2018, Morenets, Serebriakov, Sotnikov, and Minin, all using diplomatic passports, traveled to The Hague in the Netherlands in furtherance of another close access operation targeting the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) computer networks through Wi-Fi connections.\u00a0 All four GRU officers intended to travel thereafter to Spiez, Switzerland, to target the Spiez Swiss Chemical Laboratory, an accredited laboratory of the OPCW which was analyzing military chemical agents, including the chemical agent that the United Kingdom authorities connected to the poisoning of a former GRU officer in that country.\u00a0 However, Morenets, Serebriakov, Sotnikov, and Minin were disrupted during their OPCW hacking operation by the Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD), the Dutch defense intelligence service.\u00a0 As part of this disruption, Morenet\u2019s and Serebriakov\u2019s abandoned the Wi-Fi compromise equipment, which they had placed in the trunk of a rental car parked adjacent to the OPCW property.\u00a0 Data obtained from at least one item of this equipment confirmed its operational use at multiple locations around the world, including connections to the Wi-Fi network of the CCES official\u2019s hotel in Switzerland (the dates the conspirators conducted the Wi-Fi compromise of the senior CCES official\u2019s laptop at the same hotel), and at another hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in December 2017.<br/>\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><br/>\nIn connection with the unsealing of the indictment, and in an effort to limit further exposure of the private lives of victim athletes, the FBI seized the fancybears.net and fancybears.org domains pursuant to court orders issued on October 3, 2018, in the Western District of Pennsylvania.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\u00a0 Moreover, the maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentence of a defendant will be determined by the assigned judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe FBI, led by the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Field Offices, conducted the investigation that resulted in charges announced today.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s investigation was assisted by a parallel, independent Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation.\u00a0This case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\u00a0 The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout this investigation, as did the MIVD, the Government of the Netherlands, Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney General, the U.K.\u2019s National Security and Intelligence Agencies, and many of the FBI\u2019s Legal Attach\u00e9s and other foreign authorities around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: More information can be found at\u00a0<a

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p><strong><i>Remarks as Prepared for Delivery</i></strong></p>\n<p>Thank you, to the Cybersecurity Coalition and the Cyber Threat Alliance, for the invitation to speak at CyberNext DC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When I was preparing my remarks, I noticed that the theme of the conference is \u201cPrivacy, Partnerships, Protection.\u201d That\u2019s a helpful framework for my remarks today, because I want to talk about all three of those.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b><u>Protection</u></b></p>\n<p>I will start with protection, which is at the core of law enforcement\u2019s mission. Investigating crimes, building cases, and holding individuals, entities, and even nations, accountable, is a large part of how the Justice Department protects the public and contributes to cybersecurity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is fairly straightforward why: criminal prosecution is a means of reinforcing the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable state behavior, on the one hand, and that which violates accepted norms of conduct on the Internet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And imposing consequences, whether through imprisonment, fines or sanctions, or other tools, is a way of deterring malicious conduct, by raising its costs (personal, reputational, financial, and otherwise). As the First Pillar of the Administration\u2019s recent National Cyber Strategy puts it, \u201cLaw enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last year has seen significant prosecutions of foreign hackers, including those acting on behalf of foreign governments, for computer intrusions and attacks. It is worth recounting some of them, for what they show about the Department\u2019s priorities and the lengths we will go in doing our part to enforce the law and protect the public.</p>\n<p><b><i>Boyusec</i></b></p>\n<p>In October 2017, the Department announced charges against three Chinese nationals and residents who worked for a purported Internet security firm known as Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a \u201cBoyusec\u201d).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The defendants are accused of computer hacking and trade secret theft between December 2015 and March 2016. Among other things, the indictment alleges they stole a prominent economist\u2019s e-mail messages and trade secrets related to global navigation technology that \u201chad no military application,\u201d but was marketed to construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, the Indictment does not allege action by the Chinese state. But what made the defendants\u2019 alleged trade secret theft notable (besides the fact that they worked for a firm that marketed its cybersecurity services), was that it continued after China committed in September 2015 (1) not to steal trade secrets or confidential business information \u201cwith the intent of providing competitive advantages\u201d to its own companies, and (2) to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes emanating from its territory, which this did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The September 2015 commitment ushered in broad, public acceptance of a norm against computer espionage for economic benefit (soon accepted by all of the other members of the G-20). And it was incumbent on the U.S. government to hold China to the commitments it made.</p>\n<p>As we previously revealed, the Boyusec indictment was returned under seal, while we sought China\u2019s assistance in investigating and putting a stop to Boyusec\u2019s activities.\u00a0 When we received \u201cno meaningful response\u201d to those requests, there was no longer a basis to keep the charges sealed, and we made them public.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, the U.S. Trade Representative cited the Boyusec indictment in its March 2018 study of China\u2019s trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which concluded that a combination of China\u2019s practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this way, you can draw a direct line from the DOJ\u2019s indictment of China\u2019s military officers in 2014, through China\u2019s commitments in 2015, to our monitoring for compliance with those commitments, and this Administration\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic aggression, which includes state-sponsored theft of intellectual property.</p>\n<p><b><i>Mabna Institute</i></b></p>\n<p>In March of 2018, the Department announced charges against nine Iranian nationals associated with the Mabna Institute in Iran for a massive coordinated hacking campaign that targeted intellectual property and other research at more than 300 colleges and universities around the world.</p>\n<p>The very purpose of the Mabna Institute, according to the indictment, was to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations obtain access to scientific resources outside Iran. It contracted with the Iranian government (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.) as well as private organizations, and it sold some of the stolen data on websites marketed to Iranian customers.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges the campaign was executed in three phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the defendants researched which university professors were doing work of interest to the Iranians. The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</li>\n<li>Next, they e-mailed the authors, feigning interest in their work, and tricking them into clicking on malicious links, and stealing their credentials.</li>\n<li>Finally, they used those credentials to steal academic journals, theses, dissertations, and books they would not otherwise have access to.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the course of four years, the Mabna Institute and these nine individuals are accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data, intellectual property, and communications.\u00a0 That amounts to 7.75 trillion sheets of paper. (And that\u2019s printing double-sided.) U.S. universities had collectively spent $3.4 billion to have access to that intellectual property.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges themselves virtually guarantee the defendants cannot leave Iran without arrest. And on the day they were announced, the Department of the Treasury, leveraging our investigation, sanctioned the Mabna Institute and the defendants \u201cfor engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities related to the significant misappropriation of economic resources or personal identifiers for private financial gain,\u201d under a provision of Executive Order 13694 (2015).</p>\n<p><b><i>DPRK</i></b></p>\n<p>In September, the Department unsealed a massive complaint, outlining some of the government\u2019s proof behind its prior, higher-level attribution that North Korea launched a destructive malware attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 (and attempted to steal at least $1 billion from other banks), and created the malware used in the WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack last year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The complaint lays out more than 170 pages of evidence that a single conspiracy, backed by the North Korean government, was responsible for those crimes among others, and it identifies one of the men who was a member of that conspiracy.</p>\n<p>As the complaint makes clear, however, the U.S. government was not alone in this investigation.\u00a0 The complaint cites to security researchers whose expertise and dogged pursuit of the threat was critical to the allegations of the complaint. Our investigative efforts not only validate theirs, they yield specific information that expanded the security community\u2019s understanding of the Lazarus Group (a popular name for the intrusion set) and how best to protect against it.</p>\n<p><b><i>USADA, et al.</i></b></p>\n<p>Finally, this brings me to this morning\u2019s announcement of an indictment in Pittsburgh (where the first public national security cyber case was unsealed in 2014). \u00a0</p>\n<p>A grand jury there has indicted seven Russian GRU officers with an international hacking conspiracy targeting international anti-doping organizations, among others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among the conspiracy\u2019s goals: to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize those organizations, which had publicly exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored athlete doping program; and to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment also alleges how, when the efforts to obtain remote access failed to achieve their objectives, the GRU sent several of the defendants to locations where their targets were physically located. Then, using specialized equipment, those close access teams hacked the WiFi networks used by the victim organizations or their personnel (like hotel networks where they were staying).</p>\n<p>There are some who question this approach, of criminally investigating and charging hackers sponsored by foreign states, often because we have not yet arrested the defendants I have described above.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is probably easy to forget that, until relatively recently, such charges were unheard of, because for a long time, we viewed the problem of foreign state-sponsored hacking through the lens of intelligence collection alone, without regard to disruption and deterrence (which are our objectives in confronting terrorism, espionage, and other challenging national security threats).\u00a0</p>\n<p>But imagine a world in which there are <i>no </i>criminal charges, no detailed, formal allegation of wrongdoing (which the government is prepared to stand behind in court). The private sector would be left alone to accuse the guilty, without recourse.\u00a0 What message does <i>that</i> send to a foreign hacker?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Certainly not the same message we have sent to Karim Baratov, the 23-year-old hacker who worked with FSB officers to hack into e-mail accounts around the world, who was recently sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment after being arrested in Canada and waiving extradition.\u00a0 Or to Ardit Firizi, the Kosovar who was arrested in Malaysia, pled guilty here, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for giving ISIS PII for 1,300 military and government personnel, which he stole from the network of a U.S. retailer. Or to countless other hackers arrested on purely criminal charges, who thought they were safe from the consequences for their actions, because they operated under regimes that ignored (if not sponsored) their crimes.</p>\n<p>And even in the cases above (where we have yet to apprehend a defendant), the charges were never the end of the story: whether it is trade remedies, sanctions, contributions to network defense, or diplomatic efforts to rally likeminded nations to confront an adversary together, all of those charges served a greater purpose.</p>\n<p><b><u>Privacy</u></b></p>\n<p>So often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But each of the cases I described vindicates the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets, or of professors to prevent their hard-earned research from being stolen, preempted, and plagiarized; the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications or our medical records.</p>\n<p>Privacy isn\u2019t dead, but it is under attack, and much of what we are doing through law enforcement honors the privacy of innocent persons, by investigating those who would breach it. As the Sony case as well as the GRU cases illustrate, data breaches are not just trees that fall in forests when no one else is around; their consequences are often painfully visible to their victims (and the rest of the world).</p>\n<p>But leaving aside these examples of DOXing, I want to shift gears for a moment, to talk about the Department of Justice\u2019s changing approach to personal privacy, and why the privacy of your personal information can be a matter of national security.</p>\n<p>This portion of my remarks comes from a different vantage point, from my experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or CFIUS), where I represent the Department.</p>\n<p>Now CFIUS, for those of you who are not familiar, is a committee of federal departments that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security risk. When it finds risks that cannot be mitigated, it recommends actions to the President, who has the authority to prohibit a transaction.</p>\n<p>CFIUS does not review the vast majority of foreign investments in the United States. Even among those transactions we do review, we usually conclude that there are no unresolved national security concern.</p>\n<p>A classic example of the risk CFIUS examines arises when the target of an acquisition is in close proximity to a DOD facility. But an increasing focus of DOJ\u2019s work on the committee relates to data security, to the potential national security consequences of personal information ending up in the wrong hands. The kind of information I am talking about is collected every day, from thousands or even millions of consumers. Transaction information, PII, health information, even smartphone habits.</p>\n<p>Now you might ask why the security of that kind of consumer data would be relevant to CFIUS, whose mission is to protect national security. And ten years ago, or so, such information did not seem like it would be. But a few things have changed.</p>\n<p>First, the volume and variety of data has increased exponentially. Information that was not previously stored in a digital form now is. And the rate at which data are being created, the velocity of data growth, is increasing.</p>\n<p>Consider the increasing connectedness of physical devices and sensors, often referred to as the Internet of Things. Everything from medical devices, such as pacemakers, to fitness trackers, to the control systems that deliver water and power to our businesses and homes. One estimate predicts the number of Internet-connected devices will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.\u00a0 These Internet-connected devices have increased the volume, variety, and velocity of information.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Take cars, for example. Not long ago, a car was essentially a mechanical device, an engine with seats that moved you from point A to point B. Whatever limited electronic components it had were self-contained.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s cars, by contrast, contain communication devices, sensors, GPS navigation, and other computers with a variety of functions. They allow drivers to check fuel levels and tire pressure on their cell phones, track a stolen vehicle over the Internet, call for help from the car in an emergency, and access the same entertainment they\u2019re used to enjoying in their home.</p>\n<p>Another example: the universe of health information is rapidly expanding.\u00a0 More people are taking advantage of DNA testing to learn about their health, longevity, paternity, and ancestry.\u00a0 According to one 2017 report, the market for testing has become an $830 million industry. Meanwhile, our smartphones and watches are accruing ever more precise information about our health and habits.</p>\n<p>New forms and pools of data merely add to what has been collected for years, and it remains possible for a determined adversary to steal it, given enough time and resources.</p>\n<p>A second insight we have developed is that information that seems unimportant, or purely personal, or irrelevant, can, in fact, be used to threaten national security.</p>\n<p>In January, a 20-year-old Australian student discovered that open source maps of where Fitbit and other fitness device users frequently go could be used to identify military facilities in remote areas.\u00a0 As the Washington Post put it, \u201cIn war zones and deserts in countries such as Iraq and Syria, the heat map becomes almost entirely dark \u2014 except for scattered pinpricks of activity. Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases, as well as other unknown and potentially sensitive sites \u2014 presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some data might be valuable, in and of themselves, like a military secret or the admin password to an industrial control system. But other data are valuable because they are part of what a hacker or other malicious actor needs to achieve their objective, to get to their target.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The information a modern car collects provides insight into the users\u2019 network of contacts, entertainment preferences, driving habits, and locations visited on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>In the aggregate, this information provides commercial and cultural insights that might have monetary or other use. But this information about the \u201cpattern of life\u201d of a company\u2019s CEO or government official could also be used to target that individual.</p>\n<p>By themselves, the music you favor, your children\u2019s birthdates, your anniversary, and the addresses you\u2019ve lived at\u2014these are not national security secrets.</p>\n<p>But with that information, a criminal hacker could answer password reset questions or use a password cracker to obtain control of your accounts. And even if it is a personal (as opposed to a professional) account, and I might not care about the last photo <i>you</i> posted from your vacation, masquerading as you online makes it that much easier to trick the people who know you into clicking on a link or otherwise compromising their network security.</p>\n<p>Our third insight is this: the fact that most people in a data set might not be targets themselves (in fact, that only a few might be) provides little comfort. Anyone on any form of social media has learned that we are more connected than it seems. In 2016, Facebook reported that its American users were separated by fewer than 3.5 degrees of separation on average. Extrapolating what that means offline, anyone\u2019s information can be useful more for what it tells us about her brother, the CISO at a major bank, or her aunt in the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>Our concerns are exacerbated by the fact that traditional methods of de-identification of data (such as anonymization or encryption of content) may be defeated, by, for example, sensor and geolocation data, or by cross-referencing sanitized data sets against others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Researchers from two studies several years ago reported that, with a sufficient pool of data, they could distinguish a unique user of a cellphone, or a credit card, based on just four geolocations or transactions, respectively, with at least 90 percent accuracy. I cannot vouch for the methodology of those studies, but they give me pause when I think about the potential that nefarious actors could have access to large pools of such data without legal process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What does this mean for companies, and the way they should think about their data?</p>\n<p>First, and most important, they should not assume that hackers are not interested in the data or that it cannot be used to threaten national security.</p>\n<p>Second, cybersecurity policies and practices need to keep pace as businesses grow and deploy new technologies, such as biometric identification or artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Third, joint ventures or other arrangements with foreign parties may provide network access or other elements of control over data. Businesses should consider the ways an aggressive foreign intelligence service could exploit that data, <i>in light of other data it might have from other sources.</i></p>\n<p>Fourth, and finally, report computer intrusions, because the breach you think is merely a private matter, may in fact be a matter of national security.</p>\n<p><b><u>Partnerships</u></b></p>\n<p>This brings me to the final theme, partnerships. The cases we bring require true partnerships, between law enforcement and the victims who cooperate with us; between us and the intelligence community and other components of the government; and, increasingly, between our government and the governments of likeminded nations, whether in gathering and sharing information, validating our conclusions, extraditing defendants, or imposing other consequences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But as much as I believe in the value of criminal prosecutions, we have always known that we will not prosecute our way to cybersecurity. The partnership that may be most critical to our future is among the professionals in and out of government who share common goals. Which is why one of the National Security Division\u2019s greatest successes this year did not result in a criminal charge.</p>\n<p>In May, agents of the FBI were tracking a virulent botnet infecting home and office routers around the world, attributed to the same group responsible for today\u2019s indictment, known to some as \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The botnet was growing at an alarming rate by that point, and private sector researchers studying it told us they felt an increasing urgency to publish what they knew, so that affected router manufacturers, ISPs, and others could take steps to protect the public before it was too late.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no easy technical solution to this pernicious malware. Its second stage (which could steal information and even brick the device) could be cleared from memory with a simple restart, but if a router were infected, complete mitigation could be virtually impossible, short of replacement, because the first stage of malware (the actors\u2019 toe-hold in the system) would just call out for instructions to reinfect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With no time to waste, in little more than a week (including late nights and a weekend), agents and prosecutors devised the best mitigation plan they could under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>In a coordinated action,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one company would shut down the accounts that would be the primary means of reinfection, if the second stage of the malware were purged;</li>\n<li>the FBI obtained an order, allowing it to seize control of a domain that was the secondary means reinfection, and allowing it to record the IP addresses of routers that attempted to reinfect;</li>\n<li>finally, by partnering with the non-profit Shadowserver Foundation, FBI ensured that IPs of infected devices would be shared with those who could best assist their remediation, including foreign CERTs and ISPs.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Researchers drew attention to the botnet at the same time that the FBI executed the orders and blasted out a public service advisory to restart your router, purging the second stage of malware and causing the first stage to call out for instructions, now to the FBI\u2019s server, so that help could be alerted. These efforts were our best effort to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available, before Fancy Bear actors learned of the vulnerabilities in the C2 infrastructure through the research firm\u2019s imminent announcement.</p>\n<p>Last week, Cisco Talos, the research firm I mentioned, published a follow-up to its original report. It found that the VPNFilter malware possessed even greater capabilities than previously identified, in the form of third-stage malware modules that provide additional capabilities to map networks, exploit systems connected to infected devices, and obfuscate or encrypt malicious traffic.</p>\n<p>But Cisco Talos also reported, based on information from partners as well as its own analysis, that \u201cit appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since\u201d the effort I described earlier by a coalition of international partners (which included the Cyber Threat Alliance). So far, they said, there have been no signs of the actors attempting to reconnect with the devices that remain infected with the pernicious first stage of the malware. Not bad, for the first (but I promise you, not the last) effort to mitigate a botnet tied to nation-state actors.</p>\n<p>Once, there was no one. Attribution was whispered in classified channels alone. We spoke, haltingly at first, of cyber threats \u201cemanating from Asia.\u201d Then the U.S. led the way, calling out the malicious behavior of specific foreign states, first in speeches, then by indictment.</p>\n<p>Today, we are joined by three other nations in attributing specific conduct to Russia.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you where our commitment to partnership will take us next. But I can tell you, based on this, that there is reason for hope, and to continue working together to maintain an \u201copen, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.\u201d</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes for the Western District of Washington and Special Agent in Charge Jay S. Tabb Jr. of the FBI Seattle Field Office.</p>\n<p>According to three federal indictments unsealed today, Ukrainian nationals Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kolpakov, 30, are members of a prolific hacking group widely known as FIN7 (also referred to as the Carbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names).\u00a0 Since at least 2015, FIN7 members engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign targeting more than 100 U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries.\u00a0 As set forth in indictments, FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers, which the group used or sold for profit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of companies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 15 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations.\u00a0 Additional intrusions occurred abroad, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.\u00a0 Companies that have publicly disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7 include such familiar chains as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili\u2019s, Arby\u2019s, Red Robin and Jason\u2019s Deli.\u00a0 Additionally in Western Washington, FIN7 targeted other local businesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe three Ukrainian nationals indicted today allegedly were part of a prolific hacking group that targeted American companies and citizens by stealing valuable consumer data, including personal credit card information, that they then sold on the Darknet,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cBecause hackers are committed to finding new ways to harm the American public and our economy, the Department of Justice remains steadfast in its commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to identify, interdict, and prosecute those responsible for these threats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProtecting consumers and companies who use the internet to conduct business \u2013 both large chains and small \u2018mom and pop\u2019 stores -- is a top priority for all of us in the Department of Justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hayes.\u00a0 \u201cCyber criminals who believe that they can hide in faraway countries and operate from behind keyboards without getting caught are just plain wrong.\u00a0 We will continue our longstanding work with partners around the world to ensure cyber criminals are identified and held to account for the harm that they do \u2013 both to our pocketbooks and our ability to rely on the cyber networks we use.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe naming of these FIN7 leaders marks a major step towards dismantling this sophisticated criminal enterprise,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Tabb.\u00a0 \u201cAs the lead federal agency for cyber-attack investigations, the FBI will continue to work with its law enforcement partners worldwide to pursue the members of this devious group, and hold them accountable for stealing from American businesses and individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each of the three FIN7 conspirators is charged with 26 felony counts alleging conspiracy, wire fraud, computer hacking, access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In January 2018, at the request of U.S. officials, foreign authorities separately arrested Ukrainian Fedir Hladyr and a second FIN7 member, Dmytro Fedorov.\u00a0 Hladyr was arrested in Dresden, Germany, and is currently detained in Seattle pending trial.\u00a0 Hladyr allegedly served as FIN7\u2019s systems administrator who, among other things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization and held a managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction to other members of the scheme.\u00a0 Hladyr\u2019s trial is currently scheduled for Oct. 22.</p>\n<p>Fedorov, a high-level hacker and manager who allegedly supervised other hackers tasked with breaching the security of victims\u2019 computer systems, was arrested in Bielsko-Biala, Poland.\u00a0 Fedorov remains detained in Poland pending his extradition to the United States.</p>\n<p>In late June 2018, foreign authorities arrested a third FIN7 member, Ukrainian Andrii Kolpakov in Lepe, Spain.\u00a0 Kolpakov, also alleged to be a supervisor of a group of hackers, remains detained in Spain pending the United States\u2019 request for extradition.</p>\n<p>According to the indictments, FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched numerous waves of malicious cyberattacks on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad.\u00a0 FIN7 carefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a business\u2019 employee, and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the email. Once an attached file was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the notorious Carbanak malware in addition to an arsenal of other tools to ultimately access and steal payment card data for the business\u2019 customers. Since 2015, FIN7 sold the data in online underground marketplaces. (Supplemental document \u201cHow FIN7 Attacked and Stole Data\u201d explains the scheme in greater detail.)</p>\n<p>FIN7 used a front company, Combi Security, purportedly headquartered in Russia and Israel, to provide a guise of legitimacy and to recruit hackers to join the criminal enterprise.\u00a0 Combi Security\u2019s website indicated that it provided a number of security services such as penetration testing.\u00a0 Ironically, the sham company\u2019s website listed multiple U.S. victims among its purported clients.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The charges in the indictments are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The indictments are the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle Cyber Task Force of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington, with the assistance of the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Office of International Affairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, numerous computer security firms and financial institutions, FBI offices across the nation and globe, as well as numerous international agencies. Arrests overseas were executed in Poland by the \u201cShadow Hunters\u201d from CB\u015aP (Polish Central Bureau of Investigation); in Germany by the LKA Sachsen - Dezernat 33, (German State Criminal Police Office) and the Polizeidirektion Dresden (Dresden Police); and in Spain the Grupo de Seguridad Logica within the Unidad de Investigaci\u00f3n Technologica of the Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda (Spanish National Police)..</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Francis Franze-Nakamura and Steven Masada of the Western District of Washington with assistance from Trial Attorney Anthony Teelucksingh of the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div>",

The indictment charges twelve Russian nationals for committing federal crimes that were intended to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. All twelve defendants are members of the GRU, a Russian Federation intelligence agency within the Main Intelligence Directorate of\u00a0 the Russian military. These GRU officers, in their official capacities, engaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and released that information on the internet under the names \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0\" and through another entity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe Internet allows foreign adversaries to attack America in new and unexpected ways,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. \u201cTogether with our law enforcement partners, the Department of Justice is resolute in its commitment to locate, identify and seek to bring to justice anyone who interferes with American elections. Free and fair elections are hard-fought and contentious, and there will always be adversaries who work to exacerbate domestic differences and try to confuse, divide, and conquer us. So long as we are united in our commitment to the shared values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment, Viktor Borisovich Netyksho, Boris Alekseyevich Antonov, Dmitriy Sergeyevich Badin, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, Aleksey Viktorovich Lukashev,\u00a0 Sergey Aleksandrovich Morgachev, Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek, Pavel Vyacheslavovich Yershov, Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk, Aleksey Aleksandrovich Potemkin, and Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev were officials in Unit 26165 and Unit 74455 of the Russian government\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2016, officials in Unit 26165 began spearphishing volunteers and employees of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, including the campaign\u2019s chairman. Through that process, officials in this unit were able to steal the usernames and passwords for numerous individuals and use those credentials to steal email content and hack into other computers. They also were able to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) through these spearphishing techniques to steal emails and documents, covertly monitor the computer activity of dozens of employees, and implant hundreds of files of malicious computer code to steal passwords and maintain access to these networks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe officials in Unit 26165 coordinated with officials in Unit 74455 to plan the release of the stolen documents for the purpose of interfering with the 2016 presidential election. Defendants registered the domain DCLeaks.com and later staged the release of thousands of stolen emails and documents through that website. On the website, defendants claimed to be \u201cAmerican hacktivists\u201d and used Facebook accounts with fictitious names and Twitter accounts to promote the website.\u00a0 After public accusations that the Russian government was behind the hacking of DNC and DCCC computers, defendants created the fictitious persona Guccifer 2.0. On the evening of June 15, 2016 between 4:19PM and 4:56PM, defendants used their Moscow-based server to search for a series of English words and phrases that later appeared in Guccifer 2.0\u2019s first blog post falsely claiming to be a lone Romanian hacker responsible for the hacks in the hopes of undermining the allegations of Russian involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMembers of Unit 74455 also conspired to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and US companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of elections to steal voter data stored on those computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo avoid detection, defendants used false identities while using a network of computers located around the world, including the United States, paid for with cryptocurrency through mining bitcoin and other means intended to obscure the origin of the funds. This funding structure supported their efforts to buy key accounts, servers, and domains. For example, the same bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for DCLeaks.com also funded the servers and domains used in the spearphishing campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe indictment includes 11 criminal counts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Count One alleges a criminal conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States through cyber operations by the GRU that involved the staged release of stolen documents for the purpose of interfering with the 2016 president election;</li>\n<li>Counts Two through Nine charge aggravated identity theft for using identification belonging to eight victims to further their computer fraud scheme;</li>\n<li>Count Ten alleges a conspiracy to launder money in which the defendants laundered the equivalent of more than $95,000 by transferring the money that they used to purchase servers and to fund other costs related to their hacking activities through cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; and</li>\n<li>Count Eleven charges conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States by attempting to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and US companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of elections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>\nThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity or knew they were communicating with Russian intelligence officers. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the vote count or changed the outcome of the 2016 election.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone charged with a crime is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court. At trial, prosecutors must introduce credible evidence that is sufficient to prove each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, to the unanimous satisfaction of a jury of twelve citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis case was investigated with the help of the FBI\u2019s cyber teams in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and San Francisco and the National Security Division. The Special Counsel's investigation is ongoing. There will be no comments from the Special Counsel at this time.</p></div>",

Special Agents of the HSI New York Field Division, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, posed as a money launderer on Darknet market sites, exchanging U.S. currency for virtual currency.\u00a0 Through this operation, HSI New York was able to identify numerous vendors of illicit goods, leading to the opening of more than 90 active cases around the country. The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) of the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, working with more than 40 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices throughout the country, coordinated the nationwide investigation of over 65 targets, that lead to the arrest and impending prosecution of more than 35 Darknet vendors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese results were announced by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Acting Executive Associate Director Derek Benner of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Special Agent-in-Charge Angel M.

Rendina of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) New York Division, Assistant Director Kenneth Jenkins of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Office of Investigations, and Special Agent in Charge James J. Hunt of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) New York Division.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cCriminals who think that they are safe on the Darknet are wrong,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u00a0 \u201cWe can expose their networks, and we are determined to bring them to justice. Today, we arrested more than 35 alleged Darknet vendors.\u00a0 We seized their weapons, their drugs, and $23.6 million of their ill-gotten gains. This nationwide enforcement effort will reduce the supply of deadly drugs like fentanyl that are killing an unprecedented number of Americans.\u00a0 I want to thank our federal prosecutors, and the dedicated federal agents with DEA, Homeland Security Investigations, the Postal Inspection Service, and the Secret Service for their outstanding work.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe Darknet is ever-changing and increasingly more intricate, making locating and targeting those selling illicit items on this platform more complicated.\u00a0 But in this case, HSI special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyber underworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit,\u201d said\u00a0HSI Acting Executive Associate Director Benner.\u00a0 \u201cThe veil has been lifted. HSI has infiltrated the Darknet, and together with its law enforcement partners nationwide, it has proven, once again, that every criminal is within arm\u2019s reach of the law.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cPostal Inspectors and their law enforcement partners will spare no resource or expense to shine a light on the sale and distribution of illicit and dangerous items on the Darknet, that serve to destroy the lives of many through addiction and despair,\u201d said Inspector in Charge Rendina.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s announcement of our law enforcement partnership and operation sends a strong message to those who choose this illegal path, we are watching and will bring you to justice for your crimes against the American public.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe Secret Service is proud to work with our law enforcement partners to help combat one of the largest threats to the U.S. financial infrastructure, money laundering with virtual currency,\u201d said U.S. Secret Service Assistant Director Jenkins.\u00a0 \u201cThe Secret Service continues to adapt along with these cyber criminals to maintain our level of success in stopping them.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cAt this crucial time of unprecedented drug related deaths, one of the greatest threats we face is cyber drug trafficking,\u201d said DEA Special Agent in Charge Hunt. \u00a0\u201cBecause the\u00a0Darknet invites criminals into our homes, and provides unlimited access to illegal commerce, law enforcement is taking steps to identify and arrest those involved.\u00a0I applaud all the agencies who participated in this groundbreaking investigation.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extensive operation, which culminated in four weeks of more than 100 enforcement actions around the country, resulted in the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal arrests of more than 35 Darknet vendors who engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods;</li>\n<li>Execution of 70 search warrants, resulting in the seizure of massive amounts of illegal narcotics, including 333 bottles of liquid synthetic opioids, over 100,000 tramadol pills, 100 grams of fentanyl, more than 24 kilograms of Xanax, and additional seizures of Oxycodone, MDMA, cocaine, LSD, marijuana, and a psychedelic mushroom grow found in a residence;</li>\n<li>Seizure of more than 100 firearms, including handguns, assault rifles, and a grenade launcher;</li>\n<li>Seizure of five vehicles that were purchased with illicit proceeds and/or used to facilitate criminal activity;</li>\n<li>Seizure of more than $3.6 million in U.S. currency and gold bars;</li>\n<li>Seizure of nearly 2,000 Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, with an approximate value of more than $20 million;</li>\n<li>Confiscation of 15 pill presses, which are used to create illegal synthetic opioids; and</li>\n<li>Seizure of Bitcoin mining devices, computer equipment, and vacuum sealers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Amongst those charged federally, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antonio Tirado, 26, and Jeffrey Morales, 32, of the Bronx, New York, were arrested on June 18, and separately charged by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York with distribution and possession with intent to distribute narcotics, including cocaine, LSD (also known as \u201cacid\u201d), marijuana, and hashish oil.\u00a0 Additionally, Tirado was charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of his drug trafficking offenses.\u00a0 Following an investigation into a Darknet marketplace vendor using the moniker \u201cTrapgod,\u201d investigators executed search warrants at homes in two residential neighborhoods in the Bronx leading to Tirado and Morales.\u00a0 As alleged in the complaints, during the execution of the search warrants at the Tirado and Morales residences, agents seized controlled substances including powder cocaine, marijuana, and LSD, as well as various precursor powders, liquids, and reagents, and other narcotics-related paraphernalia including marijuana growing equipment, a home chemistry lab, scales, and heat sealing packaging materials.\u00a0 In Tirado\u2019s home, agents recovered a fully loaded shotgun alongside a narcotics stash.\u00a0 Investigators in Tirado\u2019s apartment recovered additional evidence of Darknet narcotics distribution, such as numerous U.S. Postal Service shipping boxes, already addressed to customers around the United States, which boxes contained hairbrushes some of which had already been packed with powder cocaine for distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jian Qu, 30; Raymond Weng, 24; and Kai Wu, 22, all of Queens, New York, along with Dimitri Tseperkas, 22, and Cihad Akkaya, 22, of Middle Island and Port Jefferson, New York, respectively, were each arrested on June 18, and charged by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York with participation in a conspiracy to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana.\u00a0 Tseperkas and Akkaya were also charged with firearms offenses relating to the drug conspiracy.\u00a0 Investigators monitoring Darknet marketplaces found accounts used by some of the conspirators, leading agents to execute search warrants at three addresses in residential communities in Flushing and Mt. Sinai, New York.\u00a0 From the residences, agents recovered approximately $400,000 in U.S. currency, 140 kilograms of suspected marijuana and an additional 10 kilograms of suspected marijuana vape cartridges, 12 kilograms of suspected Xanax pills, over half a kilogram of suspected ecstasy, four pill presses, mixers, and pill press parts, over a dozen kilograms of various powders, packaging materials, and paraphernalia.\u00a0\u00a0 While searching the residence where Akkaya and Tseperkas were found, investigators recovered three loaded shotguns, including a tactical double-barreled shotgun loaded with 14 shells, and over 50 shotgun shells, as well as significant quantities of narcotics, packaging materials, and paraphernalia including a money-counting machine.\u00a0 Review of electronic evidence recovered from the residences proved the conspirators\u2019 connections to Darknet marketplaces, use of cryptocurrency, and narcotics distribution schemes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ryan Farace, 34, of Reisterstown, Maryland, and Robert Swain, 34, of Freeland, Maryland, were charged by the U.S Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland related to a scheme to manufacture and distribute alprazolam tablets, which are typically sold under the brand name \u201cXanax.\u201d\u00a0 The indictment alleges that Farace distributed the drugs through sales on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin, and that Farace and Swain laundered the drug proceeds through financial transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.\u00a0\u00a0 To date, law enforcement has seized various crypto currency, to include bitcoin, valued at over $22 million at the time of the seizures, and over $1.5 million in cash, which was seized from Farace\u2019s residence upon the execution of a search warrant on Jan. 18.\u00a0 As part of the indictment, the government seeks the forfeiture of no less than $5.665 million, plus the value of 4,000 Bitcoin believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales, two residences, and a vehicle used to facilitate the drug distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Nicholas J. Powell, 32, and Michael Gonzalez, 27, former and current residents of Parma, Ohio, respectively, were charged by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Ohio with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and laundering money using the dark web.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that Powell used various monikers on Darknet marketplaces as part of his criminal scheme, including \u201cTheSource,\u201d \u201cBonnienClyde,\u201d BnC,\u201d \u201cBCPHARMA,\u201d and \u201cMoney TS.\u201d\u00a0 The conspiracy operated on multiple Darknet marketplaces, including Silk Road 2, AlphaBay, and HANSA.\u00a0 The conspiracy involved distributing Xanax, steroids, marijuana and other drugs across the country using these and other Darknet monikers.\u00a0 Powell and Gonzalez would then launder the funds as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Etherium, and Komodo through individuals specializing in money laundering on Darknet marketplaces.\u00a0 At the time of arrest, law enforcement had already seized approximately $437,000 in cryptocurrencies from Powell.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jose Robert Porras III, 21, and Pasia Vue, 23, both of Sacramento, were charged with drug distribution, money laundering, and illegally possessing firearms, in a 16-count indictment returned by a grand jury in the Eastern District of California.

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant of the Western District of Tennessee and Executive Assistant Director David T. Resch of the FBI, made the announcement today.</p>\n<p>Five individuals were arrested in the United States for their roles in the conspiracy including Javier Luis Ramos Alonso, 28, a Mexican citizen residing in Seaside, California; James Dean, 65, of Plainfield, Indiana; Dana Brady, 61, of Auburn, Washington; Rashid Abdulai, 24, a Ghanaian citizen residing in the Bronx, New York, who has been charged in a separate indictment; and Olufolajimi Abegunde, 31, a Nigerian citizen residing in Atlanta, Georgia. Maxwell Atugba Abayeta aka Maxwell Peter, 26, and Babatunde Martins, 62, of Ghana and Benard Emurhowhoariogho Okorhi, 39, a Nigerian citizen who resides in Ghana, have been arrested overseas and are pending extradition proceedings to face charges filed in the Western District of Tennessee.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment also charges Sumaila Hardi Wumpini, 29; Dennis Miah, 34; Ayodeji Olumide Ojo, 35, and Victor Daniel Fortune Okorhi, 35, all of whom remain at large. Abegunde had his detention hearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Sheryl H. Lipman of the Western District of Tennessee, who ordered him detained\u00a0pending trial, which has been set for Oct. 9.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants allegedly unleashed a barrage of international fraud schemes that targeted U.S. businesses and individuals, robbing them to the tune of approximately $15 million,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \u201cThe Department of Justice will continue to work with our international partners to aggressively disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises that victimize our citizens and businesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, the FBI and our partners are announcing indictments as part of Operation Keyboard Warrior,\u201d said FBI Executive Assistant Director Resch.\u00a0 \u201cFollowing the success of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/74-arrested-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds-individuals\">Operation WireWire</a> in early June, these indictments continue to demonstrate the FBI\u2019s commitment to working with our partners around the globe to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises that target Americans and their businesses.\u00a0 This should stand as a warning that our work is not over, and we will continue to work together with our law enforcement partners to put an end to these fraud schemes.

This is often accomplished by impersonating a key employee or business partner after obtaining access to that person\u2019s email account or sometimes done through romance and lottery scams.\u00a0 BEC scams may involve fraudulent requests for checks rather than wire transfers; they may target sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or employee tax records instead of, or in addition to, money; and they may not involve an actual \u201ccompromise\u201d of an email account or computer network.\u00a0 Foreign citizens perpetrate many BEC scams.\u00a0 Those individuals are often members of transnational criminal organizations, which originated in Nigeria but have spread throughout the world.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cFraudsters can rob people of their life's savings in a matter of minutes,\u201d said Attorney General Sessions. \u201cThese are malicious and morally repugnant crimes. The Department of Justice has taken aggressive action against fraudsters in recent months, conducting the largest sweep of fraud against American seniors in history back in February. Now, in this operation alone, we have arrested 42 people in the United States and 29 others have been arrested in Nigeria for alleged financial fraud. And so I want to thank the FBI, nearly a dozen U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the Secret Service, Postal Inspection Services, Homeland Security Investigations, the Treasury Department, our partners in Nigeria, Poland, Canada, Mauritius, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and our state and local law enforcement partners for all of their hard work. We will continue to go on offense against fraudsters so that the American people can have safety and peace of mind.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThis operation demonstrates the FBI\u2019s commitment to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises that target American citizens and their businesses,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u201cWe will continue to work together with our law enforcement partners around the world to end these fraud schemes and protect the hard-earned assets of our citizens. The public we serve deserves nothing less.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe Secret Service remains committed to aggressively investigating and pursuing those responsible for cyber-enabled financial crimes,\u201d said U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph \u201cTex\u201d Alles.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough the explosive expansion of the cyber domain has forced us to develop innovative ways of conducting these types of investigations, our proven model remains the same.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cFinCEN has been a leader in the fight against BEC and other cyber-enabled crime,\u201d said FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco. \u201cSince 2014, working with our domestic and international partners, our Rapid Response Program has helped recover over $350 million stolen from innocent Americans.\u00a0 We must continue to be smarter, quicker, and better than the criminals that we face every day.\u00a0 Today\u2019s action is a victory, but it will take vigilance, time, and resources to take this fight into the future.\u00a0 In defense of the victims of these crimes, we are ready for the challenge.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell. \u201cWe are proud to work alongside our fellow law enforcement partners in major efforts, such as Operation Wire Wire, to target those individuals who take advantage of the American public for illegal profits. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable, regardless of where they are. Postal Inspectors will continue to work tirelessly to protect our customers from fraud.\u201d\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nA number of cases involved international criminal organizations that defrauded small to large sized businesses, while others involved individual victims who transferred high dollar funds or sensitive records in the course of business.\u00a0 The devastating effects these cases have on victims and victim companies, affect not only the individual business but also the global economy.\u00a0 Since the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) began keeping track of BEC and its variant, Email Account Compromise (EAC), as a complaint category, there has been a loss of over $3.7 billion reported to the IC3.\u00a0 BEC and EAC is a prevalent scam and the Justice Department along with our partners will continue to aggressively pursue and prosecute the perpetrators, including money mules, regardless of where they are located.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney mules may be witting or unwitting accomplices who receive ill-gotten funds from the victims and then transfer the funds as directed by the fraudsters.\u00a0 The money is wired or sent by check to the money mule who then deposits it in his or her own bank account.\u00a0 Usually the mules keep a fraction for \u201ctheir trouble\u201d and then wire the money as directed by the fraudster.\u00a0 The fraudsters enlist and manipulate the money mules through romance scams or \u201cwork-at-home\u201d scams.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting in January 2018, this coordinated enforcement action targeted hundreds of BEC scammers.\u00a0 In addition, law enforcement agents executed over 51 domestic actions including search warrants, money mule warning letters, and asset seizure warrants totaling nearly $1 million.\u00a0 Local and state law enforcement partners on FBI task forces across the country, with the assistance of multiple District Attorney\u2019s Offices, charged 15 alleged money mules for their role in defrauding victims.\u00a0 These money mules were employed by the fraudsters to launder their ill-gotten gains by draining the funds into other accounts that are difficult to trace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong those arrested on federal charges in BEC schemes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following an investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service, 23 individuals were charged in the Southern District of Florida with laundering at least $10 million from proceeds of BEC scams, including eight people charged in an indictment unsealed last week in Miami. These eight defendants are alleged to have conspired to launder proceeds from numerous BEC scams, totaling at least approximately $5 million, including approximately $1.4 million from a victim corporation in Seattle, as well as various title companies and a law firm.</li>\n<li>Following an investigation led by the FBI with the assistance of the IRS Criminal Investigation, Gloria Okolie and Paul Aisosa, both Nigerian nationals residing in Dallas, Texas, were charged in an indictment filed on June 6 in the Southern District of Georgia.\u00a0 According to the indictment, they are alleged to have victimized a real estate closing attorney by sending the lawyer a spoofing email posing as the seller and requesting that proceeds of a real estate sale in the amount of $246,000 be wired to Okolie\u2019s account.\u00a0 They are charged with laundering approximately $665,000 in illicit funds.\u00a0 The attorney experienced $130,000 in losses after the bank was notified of the fraud and froze $116,000.</li>\n<li>Adeyemi Odufuye aka \u201cMicky,\u201d \u201cMicky Bricks,\u201d \u201cYemi,\u201d \u201cGMB,\u201d \u201cBawz\u201d and \u201cJefe,\u201d 32, and Stanley Hugochukwu Nwoke, aka Stanley Banks,\u201d \u201cBanks,\u201d \u201cHugo Banks,\u201d \u201cBanky,\u201d and \u201cJose Calderon,\u201d 27, were charged in a seven-count indictment in the District of Connecticut in a BEC scheme involving an attempted loss to victims of approximately $2.6 million, including at least $440,000 in actual losses to one victim in Connecticut.\u00a0 A third co-conspirator Olumuyiwa Yahtrip Adejumo, aka \u201cAde,\u201d \u201cSlimwaco,\u201d \u201cWaco,\u201d \u201cWaco Jamon,\u201d \u201cHade,\u201d and \u201cHadey,\u201d 32, of Toledo, Ohio, pleaded guilty on April 20 to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\u00a0 Odufuye was extradited from the United Kingdom to the United States and on Jan. 3, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. Nwoke was extradited to the United States from Mauritius on May 25, marking the first extradition in over 15 years from Mauritius.\u00a0 His case is pending.</li>\n<li>Richard Emem Jackson, aka Auwire, 23, of Lagos, Nigeria, was charged in an indictment filed on May 17 in the District of Massachusetts with two counts of unlawful possession of a means of identification as part of a larger fraud scheme.

The announcement was made by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland this afternoon while participating in a \u201cFireside Chat\u201d at the American Bar Association\u2019s 39th National Institute on White Collar Crime in San Francisco. U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey posted a statement about the case here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l64VlrA-GUA\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l64VlrA-GUA\">https://youtu.be/l64VlrA-GUA.</a></p>\n<p>According to the indictment, returned on March 5 and unsealed earlier today, Ding, 38, a national of the People\u2019s Republic of China and resident of Newark, California, stole sensitive Google trade secrets and other confidential information from Google\u2019s network to his personal account while secretly affiliating himself with PRC-based companies in the AI industry. Ding was arrested earlier this morning in Newark.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,\u201d said Attorney General Garland. \u201cIn this case, we allege the defendant stole artificial intelligence-related trade secrets from Google while secretly working for two companies based in China. We will fiercely protect sensitive technologies developed in America from falling into the hands of those who should not have them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we work to responsibly harness the benefits of AI, the Justice Department is on high alert to its risks, including global threats to our national security,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s charges, the defendant stole from Google over 500 confidential files containing AI trade secrets, while covertly working for China-based companies seeking an edge in the AI technology race. The Justice Department will relentlessly pursue and hold accountable those who would siphon disruptive technologies \u2013 especially AI \u2013 for unlawful export.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile Linwei Ding was employed as a software engineer at Google, he was secretly working to enrich himself and two companies based in the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey. \u201cBy stealing Google\u2019s trade secrets about its artificial intelligence supercomputing systems, Ding gave himself and the companies that he affiliated with in the PRC an unfair competitive advantage. This office is committed to protecting the innovation of our Silicon Valley companies. To that end, we will aggressively investigate and prosecute the theft of sensitive trade secrets by insiders like Ding, particularly when the theft endeavors to jump start illegitimate competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s charges are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People\u2019s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe theft of innovative technology and trade secrets from American companies can cost jobs and have devastating economic and national security consequences. The FBI will continue its efforts to vigorously pursue those responsible for stealing U.S. companies\u2019 intellectual property and most closely guarded secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s area of responsibility is home to internationally renowned innovation and cutting-edge technology. Unfortunately, this makes many businesses a target for criminals looking to steal crucial proprietary information, \" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp. \"This case exemplifies our commitment to protecting U.S. technologies and our ability to accelerate priority investigations when we have a pre-established relationship with private sector companies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Ding allegedly schemed to siphon off cutting-edge AI technology from Google while secretly trying to go into business with Chinese competitors,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThrough the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, we will work relentlessly to find and hold accountable those who would steal advanced American technology and jeopardize our national security and economic prosperity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the one year since its inception, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force has been relentless in protecting advanced U.S. technologies, like artificial intelligence, from malign actors,\u201d said Assistant Secretary Matthew S. Axelrod of the Commerce Department\u2019s Office for Export Enforcement. \u201cLet today\u2019s announcement serve as further warning \u2013 those who would steal sensitive U.S. technology risk finding themselves on the wrong end of a criminal indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the technology Ding allegedly stole involves the building blocks of Google\u2019s advanced supercomputing data centers, which are designed to support machine learning workloads used to train and host large AI models. According to the indictment, large AI models are AI applications capable of understanding nuanced language and generating intelligent responses to prompts, tasks, or queries. The indictment describes how Google developed both proprietary hardware and software to facilitate the machine learning process powered by its supercomputing data centers. With respect to hardware, Google uses advanced computer chips with the extraordinary processing power required to facilitate machine learning and run AI applications. With respect to software, Google deploys several layers of software, referred to in the indictment as the \u201csoftware platform,\u201d to orchestrate machine learning workloads efficiently. For example, one component of the software platform is the Cluster Management System (CMS), which functions as the \u201cbrain\u201d of Google\u2019s supercomputing data centers. The CMS organizes, prioritizes, and assigns tasks to the hardware infrastructure, allowing the advanced chips to function efficiently when executing machine learning workloads or hosting AI applications.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Google hired Ding as a software engineer in 2019. Ding\u2019s responsibilities included developing the software deployed in Google\u2019s supercomputing data centers. In connection with his employment, Ding was granted access to Google\u2019s confidential information related to the hardware infrastructure, the software platform, and the AI models and applications they supported. The indictment alleges that on May 21, 2022, Ding began secretly uploading trade secrets that were stored in Google\u2019s network by copying the information into a personal Google Cloud account. According to the indictment, Ding continued periodic uploads until May 2, 2023, by which time Ding allegedly uploaded more than 500 unique files containing confidential information.</p>\n<p>In addition, the indictment alleges that Ding secretly affiliated himself with two PRC-based technology companies. According to the indictment, on or about June 13, 2022, Ding received several emails from the CEO of an early-stage technology company based in the PRC indicating Ding had been offered the position of Chief Technology Officer for the company. Ding allegedly traveled to the PRC on Oct. 29, 2022, and remained there until March 25, 2023, during which time he participated in investor meetings to raise capital for the new company. The indictment alleges potential investors were told Ding was the new company\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and that Ding owned 20% of the company\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, unbeknownst to Google, by no later than May 30, 2023, Ding had founded his own technology company in the AI and machine learning industry and was acting as the company\u2019s CEO. Ding\u2019s company touted the development of a software platform designed to accelerate machine learning workloads, including training large AI models. As alleged in the indictment, Ding applied to a PRC-based startup incubation program and traveled to Beijing, to present his company at an investor conference on Nov. 24, 2023. As set forth in the indictment, a document related to Ding\u2019s startup company stated, \u201cwe have experience with Google's ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it - and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China's national conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges Ding\u2019s conduct violated his employment agreement as well as a separate code of conduct that Ding signed when he became a Google employee. Further, the indictment describes measures that Ding allegedly took to conceal his theft of the trade secrets. For example, he allegedly copied data from Google source files into the Apple Notes application on his Google-issued MacBook laptop. By then converting the Apple Notes into PDF files and uploading them from the Google network into as separate account, Ding allegedly evaded detection by Google\u2019s data loss prevention systems. Likewise, the indictment describes how in December 2023 Ding allegedly permitted another Google employee to use his Google-issued access badge to scan into the entrance of a Google building \u2013 making it appear he was working from his U.S. Google office when, in fact, he was in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Ding is charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, Ding faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine for each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI and Commerce Department are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and Justice Department National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s action was coordinated through the Justice and Commerce Departments\u2019 Disruptive Technology Strike Force. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation-states.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/media/1341391/dl?inline\" title=\"ding_indictment_filed.pdf\">ding_indictment_filed.pdf</a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>",

The indictment alleges Naganathanahalli used his access to the computer system to replace real data with masked data causing damage to an important Vituity database.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vituity comprises a group of related companies based in Emeryville, Calif., including physician partnerships and other entities. According to the indictment, Vituity maintained a computer database that was central to its business and was connected to systems responsible for hiring and payroll, among other functions. The indictment alleges that in late May of 2022, Naganathanahalli was informed that his employment with Vituity would be terminated in mid-June. The indictment alleges that after he was informed his employment would be terminated, but before his last day on the job, he changed a password to another employee\u2019s account so he would be able to gain access to a Vituity computer system after access to Vituity\u2019s computers using his own password was revoked. Further, the indictment alleges that in September 2022, Naganathanahalli used the changed password to access a Vituity computer system remotely, change yet another employee\u2019s password, and then use that employee\u2019s account to overwrite the company\u2019s personnel data.

Hinds and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan. The sentence was handed down by United States District Judge Edward J. Davila.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll children, wherever they are, must be protected from being preyed upon by a sexual predator,\u201d said United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. \u201cJohnny Ray Wolfenbarger leveraged the extreme poverty and desperation of foreign families to perpetrate sexual abuse on their young children. His prison sentence reflects these vile acts and the immeasurable harm he caused to these children\u2019s lives.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChild exploitation deprives children of their basic rights to safety and well-being. The physical and emotional trauma the defendant inflicted on child victims may alter their lives for years to come,\u201d said FBI San Francisco Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan. \u201cChildren deserve to be free from exploitation. It is of utmost importance to the FBI that children are made safe and that the creators of child pornography are caught and pay for their crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCBP protects the public from many threats. The prosecution of child predators is only one aspect of our multi-faceted mission,\u201d said CBP Acting Director of Field Operations Bruce Murley. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our Federal and State law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the most vulnerable in our society.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wolfenbarger, 65, of Morgan Hill, was convicted by a federal jury on August 12, 2021, of all child sexual abuse offenses charged against him. According to evidence presented at trial, the FBI initiated an investigation into Wolfenbarger after receiving a CyberTipline report from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) that Wolfenbarger received and distributed child pornography using his email account. In 2016, a federal magistrate judge issued a search warrant authorizing the FBI to examine the contents of the email account for child pornography. The FBI executed the warrant on the email account and discovered numerous images and videos of child pornography, chats detailing Wolfenbarger\u2019s solicitation of livestreamed child sex abuse shows, and receipts for money transfers by Wolfenbarger to numerous sex traffickers the Philippines who were selling these shows. The chats demonstrated that Wolfenbarger customized these livestreamed sex shows by directing the children to engage in specific sex acts on camera.</p>\n<p>Further trial evidence showed Wolfenbarger traveled to the Philippines throughout 2015 and early 2016. On August 2, 2016, he returned to the United States. Upon his arrival, an FBI Special Agent interviewed Wolfenbarger. Wolfenbarger admitted during the interview that the email account belonged to him. He further admitted that he solicited, paid for, and directed livestreamed child sex abuse shows from numerous women in the Philippines. Wolfenbarger directed the children in the shows to engage in sex acts by themselves, upon each other, and upon adults, and directed the use of bottles, vibrators, and other sex toys during these acts. He also directed adults in the show to engage in sex acts upon the children and to use the sex toys upon them. The children who were in these shows engaging in sex acts, Wolfenbarger admitted, were twelve years old and younger \u2013 including as young as four years old.</p>\n<p>Wolfenbarger further described that he watched the livestreamed child sex abuse on his desktop and laptop computers at his home in California. Trial evidence showed that he paid for the live webcam sessions via Western Union and by using the tip function of the webcam service. Western Union records documented over $25,000 in money transfers from Wolfenbarger to individuals in the Philippines. On several occasions, Wolfenbarger sent money to the children or their guardians for living expenses and to purchase sex toys and web cams, with the explicit understanding that he would receive sex shows in return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The government\u2019s trial evidence included Wolfenbarger\u2019s recorded statements, records of his chats, images and videos of child pornography attached to emails that Wolfenbarger received and sent, and Western Union records of money transfers sent by Wolfenbarger to pay for the livestreamed child sex abuse.</p>\n<p>In a memo filed for sentencing, the government highlighted Wolfenbarger\u2019s callousness towards the children. Online sexual exploitation of vulnerable children in the Philippines has greatly increased in recent years due to demand from pedophiles in wealthy Western nations, the government described. In this case, the government outlined how the extreme poverty of the young victims and their families provided extensive leverage to Wolfenbarger, who used his payments to induce the young victims and their families to create sex shows for him. Several sex chats feature victims\u2019 requests for money to pay for food, overdue rent, school fees, and other necessities. As an example, in one chat a young victim asked Wolfenbarger for money to attend a school Christmas party with her cousin. Wolfenbarger wired her approximately $30 worth of Philippine Pesos, then added, \u201cdad need a good show later my daughter.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The federal jury convicted Wolfenbarger of all counts in the superseding indictment. The mandatory minimum and statutory maximum sentences for the crimes are as follows:\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for attempted production of child pornography in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2251(a) and (e): imprisonment for a minimum term of 15 years and a maximum term of 30 years; and a minimum term of supervised release of 5 years and a maximum of life;\u00a0</li>\n<li>for attempted coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in the production of child pornography in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422(b): imprisonment for a minimum term of 10 years and a maximum term of life; and a minimum term of supervised release of 5 years and a maximum of life; and\u00a0</li>\n<li>for the receipt of child pornography in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2252(a)(2): imprisonment for a minimum term of 5 years and a maximum term of 20 years; and a minimum term of supervised release of 5 years and a maximum of life.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the 210 month prison term, Judge Davila sentenced Wolfenbarger to a 15 year term of supervision upon release from federal prison. The defendant was in custody at the hearing and begins serving his prison term immediately.</p>\n<p>This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys' Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims. For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/psc\">http://www.justice.gov/psc</a>.</p>\n<p>Assistant United States Attorneys Marissa Harris and Maia Perez prosecuted the case, with the assistance of paralegal Mimi Lam and legal assistants Susan Kreider and Sahib Kaur. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Hinds and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment filed in 2012, Doyon, 56, formerly of Mountain View and now a resident of Mexico City, Mexico, failed to appear at a February 2, 2012, status conference after being placed on pretrial release in a 2011 criminal case.\u00a0 The status conference was set in case number 11-683 when Doyon was ordered to appear before United States District Judge Lowell D.

(UMC), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry, pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and was sentenced to pay a $60 million fine, in exchange for its agreement to cooperate with the government in the investigation and prosecution of its co-defendant, a Chinese state-owned-enterprise.\u00a0 The plea was accepted by the Hon. Maxine M. Chesney, U.S. District Judge.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury had indicted UMC in September 2018, along with Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd. (Fujian Jinhua), a state-owned enterprise of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and three individuals for conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess stolen trade secrets of an American semiconductor company (Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron)) for the benefit of a state-owned enterprise of the PRC (Fujian Jinhua).\u00a0 As a result of today\u2019s guilty plea, and in accordance with an accompanying plea agreement, UMC, whose American Depository Receipts are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, will pay the fine\u2014the second largest ever in a criminal trade secret prosecution, be subject to a three-year term of probation, and cooperate with the United States.</p>\n<p>\u201cUMC's guilty plea points this case towards trial against Fujian Jinhua in 2021,\" said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson.\u00a0 \"Criminal trade secrets cases protect freedom and innovation.\u00a0 These cases have global significance when a foreign defendant is charged with stealing intellectual property protected by U.S. law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUMC stole the trade secrets of an American leader in computer memory to enable China to achieve a strategic priority: self-sufficiency in computer memory production without spending its own time or money to earn it,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen. \u201cThis prosecution is an example of the Department of Justice\u2019s successful efforts to defend American companies from those who try to cheat and steal their technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cU.S. companies possess some of the most sensitive and valuable intellectual property in the world. That\u2019s why the Government of China continues to incentivize its theft. The FBI and its law enforcement partners here and around the world are working to combat the Government of China\u2019s rampant theft of technology,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David L. Bowdich.\u00a0 \u201cWe won\u2019t stop investigating these crimes, and we won\u2019t stop partnering with the private sector to protect our nation\u2019s economic and national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>UMC pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging the company with one count of criminal trade secret theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(3). The other criminal charges and a parallel civil suit by the United States against UMC will be dismissed. The criminal prosecution of Fujian Jinhua and the three individual defendants will continue, as will a civil action seeking to enjoin Fujian Jinhua from the further transfer of stolen trade secrets and the export to the United States of products manufactured by Fujian Jinhua that were made using the stolen trade secrets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cProtecting American intellectual property and trade secrets is a top priority for the FBI.\u00a0 This is especially true for the FBI\u2019s San Francisco Division, with Silicon Valley in our area of responsibility, and we will continue to lead the fight in safeguarding U.S. innovation from foreign adversaries,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Fair.\u00a0 \u201cThis case sends an important message to Bay Area companies: if you report suspicious activity to the FBI, we will follow all investigative leads to identify and prosecute those responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the facts admitted in connection with the guilty plea, UMC hired the three individual defendants\u2014Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang\u2014from Micron\u2019s Taiwan subsidiary. UMC made Chen a senior vice president and assigned him to lead negotiation of an agreement with Fujian Jinhua to develop Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) technology for Fujian Jinhua.</p>\n<p>As a foundry company, UMC previously made logic chips designed by other companies but did not make DRAM memory chips. Chen hired Ho and Wang to join the DRAM development team, and Ho and Wang brought Micron\u2019s confidential information to UMC from Micron\u2019s Taiwan subsidiary. After UMC\u2019s Information Technology Department found Micron\u2019s intellectual property on Ho\u2019s UMC computer, Chen approved the issuance of two \u201coff network\u201d laptop computers that allowed UMC employees to access Micron confidential information without further detection by UMC\u2019s IT department. In particular, Wang used one file containing Micron\u2019s trade secrets to adjust UMC\u2019s design rules for the memory in question. Later, when Taiwan authorities searched UMC\u2019s offices, Ho and Wang asked another UMC employee to hide papers, notes, USB drives, a personal phone, and a laptop computer while the Taiwan authorities executed their search warrants. Taiwan authorities recovered only one of the two off-network laptops. The hard drive of the other was reformatted and concealed from Taiwan authorities. Beginning in the month of the Taiwan raids, Chen became president of Fujian Jinhua and took charge of its memory production facility.</p>\n<p>This prosecution is a result of an investigation by the FBI. Substantial assistance was provided by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice, its Ministry of Justice Investigation\u2019s Bureau (MJIB), and the Taichung District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (TDPO).\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Brockman, the Chief Executive Officer of an Ohio-based software company, with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses, announced U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Tax Division, and Chief of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Jim Lee. The charges stem from an alleged decades-long scheme to conceal approximately $2 billion in income from the IRS as well as a scheme to defraud investors in the software company\u2019s debt securities.</p>\n<p>\u201cComplexity will not hide crime from law enforcement,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cSophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges.\u00a0 We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment reflects the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to finding and prosecuting the costliest and most sophisticated tax crimes in the United States,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division Richard E. Zuckerman.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Mr. Brockman is responsible for carrying out an approximately two billion dollar tax evasion scheme,\u201d said Jim Lee, Chief of IRS Criminal Investigation. \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation aggressively pursues tax cheats domestically and abroad. No scheme is too complex or sophisticated for our investigators. Those hiding income or assets offshore are encouraged to come forward and voluntarily disclose their holdings.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Brockman, a resident of Houston, Texas, and Pitkin County, Colorado, used a web of offshore entities based in Bermuda and Nevis to hide from the IRS income earned on his investments in private equity funds which were managed by a San Francisco-based investment firm. As part of the alleged scheme, Brockman directed untaxed capital gains income to secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. The indictment further alleges that to execute the fraud, between 1999 and 2019, Brockman took measures such as backdating records and using encrypted communications and code words to communicate with a co-conspirator, among other alleged actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the tax offenses, the indictment alleges that, between 2008 and 2010, Brockman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $67.8 million in the software company\u2019s debt securities. As CEO, Brockman was contractually restricted from purchasing any of the software company\u2019s debt securities without prior notice, full disclosure, and amending the associated credit agreements. The indictment alleges that Brockman used a third-party to circumvent those requirements, to acquire the debt securities, and to conceal from the sellers valuable economic information. The indictment further alleges that Brockman used material, non-public information about the software company to make decisions about purchasing the debt.\u00a0 In addition, Brockman allegedly persuaded another individual to alter, destroy, and mutilate documents and computer evidence with the intent to impair the use of such evidence in a grand jury investigation.\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\nBrockman is charged with conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; seven counts of tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201; six counts of failing to file foreign bank account reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5314 &amp; 5322(b); 20 counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; two counts of concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)), and tax evasion money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(ii)); and one count each of international concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)); evidence tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(2)(B), and destruction of evidence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(1).\u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Brockman potentially faces a substantial period of incarceration, as well as restitution and criminal forfeiture. Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p>Brockman is scheduled to make his initial federal court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael M. Cousins this morning.</p>\n<p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael G. Pitman, Senior Litigation Counsel Corey Smith of the Tax Division, and Trial Attorneys Lee Langston and Christopher Magnani of the Tax Division.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs of the Department\u2019s Criminal Division also provided extensive assistance in this matter.</p></div>",

Alsup, U.S. District Court Judge.\u00a0 The trial initially began in March, but proceedings were suspended after just two days in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing closure of the federal courthouse.\u00a0 When trial resumed on July 7, 2020, the defendant, the attorneys, and Judge Alsup wore masks, and witnesses testified from behind a glass panel to allow for social distancing requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdicts are the result of our first federal jury trial in San Francisco since the beginning of shelter in place.\u00a0 I am immensely grateful to Judge Alsup for getting this case to trial.\u00a0 Trial by jury is one of the defining features of the American justice system.\u00a0 We need jury trials to administer justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cNikulin\u2019s conviction is a warning to would-be hackers, wherever they may be.\u00a0 Computer hacking is not just a crime, it is a direct threat to the security and privacy of Americans.\u00a0 American law enforcement will respond to that threat regardless of where it originates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nikulin, 32, of Moscow, Russia, was indicted by a federal grand jury on October 20, 2016.\u00a0 He was charged with multiple counts of computer hacking, fraud, and identity theft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nikulin has been in custody since his extradition from the Czech Republic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nikulin\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 29, 2020, before Judge Alsup in San Francisco.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count of selling stolen usernames and passwords in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) and for each count of installing malware on protected computers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01030(a)(5) is 10 years, along with a fine of up to $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0371 and computer hacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01030(a)(2)(C) is five years, along with a fine of up to $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate.\u00a0 There is also a mandatory two year sentence for any conviction of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01028A(1).\u00a0 However, any sentence will be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p>Michelle Kane and Katherine Wawrzyniak are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Helen Yee, Jessica Rodriguez Gonzalez, and Kim Richardson.\u00a0 The prosecution is the result of a four-year investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of authorities in the Czech Republic and the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, Office of International Affairs.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Mihran Stepanyan, Artur Stepanyan, Yan German, and Khachig Geuydjian pleaded guilty today to crimes stemming from their respective roles in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy involving diversion of prescription drugs, money laundering, bank fraud, identity theft, and additional crimes, announced United States Attorney David L. Anderson; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett; and Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation, Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter.\u00a0 The pleas were accepted by the Hon. Charles R. Breyer, United States District Judge, and leaves one remaining defendant to stand trial for allegations made in a Second Superseding Indictment filed in February of 2016 against 38 defendants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPatients needing prescription drugs shouldn\u2019t have to worry that their medications came out of a back alley,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Anderson.\u00a0 \u201cThe defendants and their co-conspirators were able to make massive profits by diverting street drugs back into mainstream channels while creating false paperwork to conceal their true source.\u00a0 Thanks to the FBI, IRS, and federal prosecutors in San Francisco, the defendants now face the prospect of lengthy prison sentences for their criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe American public was victimized twice by this scheme,\u201d said FBI San Francisco Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. \u201cThe majority of the profits were subsidized both by American taxpayers and by those paying private insurance premiums.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, patients were put at risk by the movement of these black market drugs, as the defendants disregarded general safety protocols and guidelines, to include expiration dates and pharmaceutical lot numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s guilty pleas bring us one step closer to closing the chapter on this criminal enterprise,\u201d said Kareem Carter, Special Agent in Charge IRS Criminal Investigation. \u201cThe crimes committed by these defendants ranged from picking up drugs at a pizza shop to a half-million-dollar tax check fraud scheme.\u00a0 In total, more than $199 million in diverted prescription drug proceeds were laundered through bank accounts established with false identities and shell companies.\u00a0 IRS-CI is committed to following the money so we can financially disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations like these.\u201d</p>\n<p>All four defendants pleading guilty today\u2014Mihran Stepanyan (M. Stepanyan), his cousin Artur Stepanyan (A. Stepanyan), German, and Geuydjian\u2014have acknowledged that they were members of a nationwide conspiracy referred to in court documents as the Karapedyan-Stepanyan Enterprise (Enterprise).\u00a0 One key aspect of the criminal activity was a multi-million dollar prescription drug diversion scheme.\u00a0 According to the plea agreements filed today, members and associates of the Enterprise procured prescription drugs from unlicensed sources, usually street dealers, and resold the drugs to unknowing customers.\u00a0 The Stepanyans also admitted that they are not licensed to sell drugs, that they procured millions of dollars of drugs through street suppliers and other unlicensed sources, and that the drugs they procured eventually were resold as legitimate products.</p>\n<p>The Stepanyans\u2019 plea agreements include an overview of the complexity and sophistication of the Enterprise\u2019s operations.\u00a0 Members of the Enterprise conducted the affairs of the organization through a pattern of racketeering and committed crimes throughout California as well as in Minnesota, Ohio, and Puerto Rico.\u00a0 Further, the Stepanyans\u2019 plea agreements describe how members and associates of the Enterprise procured and distributed a wide variety of drugs from unlicensed sources for distribution throughout the country.\u00a0 The drugs included medications used to treat HIV infection, Type-2 diabetes, dementia, and high blood pressure, among other conditions.\u00a0 Members and associates of the Enterprise also created false and fraudulent paperwork, referred to as pedigrees, to make it appear that those drugs had been purchased from legitimate sources.\u00a0 In addition, they created sham companies and used multiple bank accounts to receive and distribute the proceeds from their fraudulent transactions.\u00a0 The plea agreements also describe how the Stepanyans, along with other members and associates of the Enterprise, intentionally used the identities of real people to carry out their unlawful objectives.\u00a0 The plea agreements of Geuydjian and German provide further details of the Enterprise\u2019s operations.\u00a0 Specifically, Geuydjian\u2019s plea agreement describes how he negotiated fraudulent personal and tax checks for the benefit of the Enterprise, and German\u2019s plea agreement describes how he supplied drugs for distribution by the Enterprise and managed aspects of the Enterprise\u2019s money laundering operations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to M. Stepanyan\u2019s plea agreement, he became a member of the Enterprise as early as January 2010.\u00a0 He admitted that he agreed with his co-conspirators to commit multiple criminal acts involving money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, identity theft, and multiple acts involving the distribution of drugs from unlicensed sources to conduct the affairs of the Enterprise.\u00a0 In his plea agreement, M. Stepanyan admitted that he controlled several entities, including Red Rock Capital Group, Inc.; Trans Atlantic Capital Group, Inc.; GC National Wholesale, Inc.; and Sky Atlantic Group, Inc., in addition to numerous bank accounts through which approximately $199 million of pharmaceutical money flowed between 2010 and 2014.\u00a0 M. Stepanyan also admitted purchasing approximately $56 million in gold using the illicit proceeds from the unlawful sale of prescription drugs.\u00a0 As a further example of his participation in the Enterprise, M. Stepanyan used an entity called Niva Pharmaceuticals to facilitate transactions related to the criminal conspiracy.\u00a0 Specifically, M. Stepanyan admitted that in January of 2014, he purchased Niva from a co-conspirator who had set up the company.\u00a0 Although Niva was licensed to engage in drug wholesaling in California, it was not and did not engage in wholesale drug distribution.\u00a0 Instead, M. Stepanyan acknowledged, Niva was nothing more than a shell company with offices that generally were empty except for a desk, a computer, and tables for drugs that the Enterprise procured.\u00a0 The plea agreement describes how Enterprise members stored boxes of drugs in Niva\u2019s offices and shipped them throughout the country using fraudulent labels that suggested the drugs were being shipped by or to authentic companies, including a legitimate drug company operating in Puerto Rico.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A. Stepanyan also admitted in his plea agreement that he was a member of the Enterprise beginning in at least January of 2010.\u00a0 Between 2010 and 2015, he directed and participated in a prescription drug diversion scheme whereby he procured drugs from various unlicensed sources and sold them to a co-defendant who, in turn, sold the drugs to pharmacies throughout the United States.\u00a0 Further, A. Stepanyan admitted that the gross receipts for the sale of those diverted prescription drugs was at least $199 million.\u00a0 According to the plea agreement, A. Stepanyan and his cousin, M. Stepanyan, laundered those proceeds through various bank accounts established in false identities, which M. Stepanyan controlled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>German admitted in his plea agreement that he was a member of the Enterprise between 2013 and 2015.\u00a0 He acknowledged that he was responsible for establishing a network of unlicensed street suppliers to provide drugs for the distribution scheme.\u00a0 As described in his plea agreement, German had multiple sources of drugs.\u00a0 Between 2013 and 2014, he obtained boxes full of prescription drugs from one of his co-conspirators in Los Angeles, California.\u00a0 For example, he would pick up drugs from one of his sources at a pizza shop with the help of one of his associates, load the boxes into the trunk of a car, and drive them to a nearby mall or another pre-arranged location where he would deliver them to the Stepanyans.\u00a0 German also admitted that in his role managing money-laundering operations for the Enterprise, he assisted with wire fraud, bank fraud, identity theft, and illegal check cashing schemes.\u00a0 In the plea agreement, German admits that he used his birth name, Henrik Hartyunyan, during some of the underlying illegal conduct he performed on behalf of the Enterprise.</p>\n<p>Geuydjian admitted that he was a member of the Enterprise from at least 2012 through approximately 2014.\u00a0 In his plea agreement, he describes himself as a \u201cmoney launderer for the Enterprise.\u201d\u00a0 Geuydjian acknowledged that he and others in the Enterprise created sham companies and used multiple bank accounts to receive and distribute the proceeds from the fraudulent transactions.\u00a0 Geuydjian liquidated tax fraud and drug diversion proceeds by making deposits to a number of sham corporate entities that he created and allowed other members and associates of the Enterprise to use his businesses to send illicit funds and other merchandise.\u00a0 Furthermore, Geuydjian used the identities of real people to carry out many of the Enterprise\u2019s unlawful objectives.\u00a0 For example, the plea agreement describes how Geuydjian\u2019s co-conspirators acquired and possessed stolen identifying information for dozens of individuals in order to file fraudulent tax returns online.\u00a0 The Enterprise obtained checks issued by the federal government and mailed from the United States Treasury based on fraudulent tax returns.\u00a0 From approximately August 2012 through August 2013, Geuydjian fraudulently liquidated approximately 51 checks totaling more than $538,295 though accounts he held in the names of three companies he controlled.\u00a0 Geuydjian also used photocopies of driver\u2019s licenses, social security cards, or other personal identifying with the identities of real people to open bank accounts or gain access to the victims\u2019 bank accounts, to negotiate checks made out in the victims\u2019 names.\u00a0 Furthermore, Geudjian and his co-conspirators perpetrated a tax check fraud scheme.\u00a0 For example, in March 2014, Geudjian deposited two tax refund checks into fraudulent Wells Fargo bank accounts\u2014one in the amount of $117,887 and another in the amount of $131,205.\u00a0 These checks, which were from legitimate tax return filings, were stolen out of the mail by \u201crunners\u201d employed by members of the conspiracy.\u00a0 Geudjian also liquidated approximately $71,806 that his co-conspirators stole from a victim\u2019s Fidelity 401K retirement account.</p>\n<p>On February 11, 2016, a federal grand jury handed down the Second Superseding Indictment charging the four defendants\u2014as well as 34 additional individuals\u2014with various crimes in connection with the activities of the Enterprise.\u00a0 All four defendants pleading guilty today are released on bond pending sentencing.\u00a0 A

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 This morning, former Informix executive Walter Konigseder appeared in federal court to face investment fraud charges laid out in an 11-count indictment filed in October of 2000, announced United States Attorney David L. Anderson and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Konigseder, 67, a German national, on October 5, 2000. \u00a0According to the indictment, in the early 1990s, Konigseder was the Sales Director and Country Manager for Germany of Menlo Park-based Informix, a multinational, publicly held computer software developer, support, training, and consulting company. \u00a0From 1992 through 1996, Konigseder had authority over Informix\u2019s sales force, finance, and legal staff within all of Central and Eastern Europe. \u00a0The indictment alleges that Konigseder caused Informix to record false and illusory sales, to make false statement to Informix\u2019s auditors and management, and to book license revenue in advance, rather than over the period of maintenance contracts. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment describes how Konigseder engaged in numerous acts of alleged wrongdoing in connection with Informix\u2019s restatement in 1997 of its 1996 earnings. \u00a0The indictment alleges that Konigseder\u2019s fraud contributed to the need for Informix to restate its 1996 earnings. \u00a0Between April and September of 1997, Informix therefore restated its previous year\u2019s growth. \u00a0The result was a 60% drop in its stock value\u2014a change to the company\u2019s value from approximately $2.5 billion to as low as $975 million. \u00a0For example, the indictment describes six illusionary sales between June of 1996 and January of 1997 in which Konigseder, contrary to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, directed Informix to recognize more than $25 million in revenue on contracts that contained contingencies. \u00a0Further, the indictment describes how Konigseder allegedly concealed material facts from Informix\u2019s auditors. \u00a0In July of 1997, for example, Konigseder allegedly reported to Informix\u2019s auditors that a client did not make a multi-million dollar payment because the client was hoping to expand on the existing contract with Informix. \u00a0In truth, Konigseder was aware that the client had exercised a side agreement canceling the contract with Informix altogether. \u00a0The indictment also alleges Konigseder caused Informix to make false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission overstating the company\u2019s earnings in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1996.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In sum, Konigseder was charged with three counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 2; four counts of accounting fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b) and 78ff(a), 17 C.F.R. 240.13b2-1, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and three counts of false statements to accountants, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(2) and 78ff(a), 17 C.F.R. 240.13b2-2, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A bench warrant was issued for Konigseder\u2019s arrest on October 5, 2000. \u00a0At that time he was residing in Germany and remained there for almost 19 years after being indicted. \u00a0Konigseder was arrested by Mauritius authorities in August while on a trip to that country. \u00a0He was handed over to United States authorities on October 9 and arrived in the United States on Friday, October 11. \u00a0He made his initial federal court appearance at 10:30 this morning before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. \u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each count of wire fraud, 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and up to $1 million for each count of falsification of accounting records and false statements to accountants. \u00a0In addition, the court may order additional periods of supervised release, fines, and restitution, if appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Frentzen is prosecuting the case. \u00a0The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Department of Justice Office of International Affairs, Mauritius, and the United States Marshal Service.\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Chen, United States District Judge.</p>\n<p>In May of 2018, Fry, 54, of San Francisco, was an Investigative Analyst for the Internal Revenue Services\u2019 law enforcement arm, the Criminal Investigation Division. \u00a0Fry\u2019s responsibilities included supporting IRS Agents in the Northern District of California area and reviewing SARs for activity that could potentially lead to a criminal investigation. \u00a0In his position with the IRS, he had access to various law enforcement databases, including the FinCEN database that manages the collection and maintenance of SARs and an analytic software used to integrate investigative data from multiple internal and external data sources. According to his plea agreement, he admitted he knowingly and willingly disclosed confidential SAR information to Michael Avenatti. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Financial institutions trust that FinCEN will safeguard the sensitive information like SARs they are obligated to file, which is absolutely critical to protecting our national security\u201d said FinCEN Director Blanco. \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to protect this information, and we will not hesitate to investigate and help prosecute anyone who breaks the law by disclosing or misusing protected data.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen an IRS employee accesses and misuses government data, and then discloses that data for personal reasons, their selfish actions erode confidence in the IRS and in the institutions that are tasked with protecting this data,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ammari. \u00a0\u201cThe Treasury Inspector for Tax Administration, along with our law enforcement partners, are committed to prosecuting these individuals to the fullest extent to deter illegal disclosures in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the plea agreement, Fry admitted that on May 4, 2018, he logged onto the a private government database from his work computer and downloaded five SARs related to Michael Cohen and his company Essential Consultants. \u00a0Fry further admitted he twice called Michael Avenatti, an attorney based in Newport Beach, Calif., from his personal cell phone. \u00a0Fry acknowledged that during his phone conversations with Avenatti, he verbally provided information to Michael Avenatti that was contained in the five SARs. \u00a0Fry further admitted that he used one of his personal email accounts to email screenshots of the SARs to Michael Avenatti. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Further, Fry admitted that on May 7, 2018, he logged on to the FinCEN database from his work computer and conducted additional searches related to Michael Cohen and Essential Consultants. \u00a0He then called Michael Avenatti from his personal cell phone and verbally provided information contained in the searches. \u00a0Fry admitted he had no official reason to disclose SAR records related to Cohen or the various companies listed in the SARs.</p>\n<p>On February 28, 2019, a federal grand jury indicted Fry with one count of unauthorized disclosure of suspicious activity reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a); two counts of misuse of a computer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2); and one count of illegal use of a social security number, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(8). \u00a0Fry pleaded guilty to the unauthorized disclosure count. \u00a0If Fry complies with the plea agreement, the remaining counts will be dismissed at sentencing.</p>\n<p>Judge Chen scheduled Fry\u2019s sentencing for December 18, 2019. \u00a0Fry faces a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison, and a fine of $250,000, for the violation. \u00a0However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. \u00a0</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions Section of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California. \u00a0This case was investigated by FinCEN and TIGTA.<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Anderson; Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Spradlin; Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security Acting Special Agent in Charge Todd Harris; U.S. Customs and Border Protection Director of Field Operations Brian Humphrey; and U.S. Marshals Service Marshal Donald M. O\u2019Keefe. \u00a0Kosmachov was extradited to the United States from Estonia to face the charges.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment filed September 21, 2017, and unsealed this morning, Kosmachov, 66, is an Estonian national and resident of Tallinn, Estonia. \u00a0He served as owner of Adimir OU and co-owner of Eastline Technology OU, along with co-defendant and Russian national Sergey Vetrov, 66. \u00a0The indictment describes how Kosmachov and Vetrov used the Estonia-based companies as procurement \u201cfronts\u201d to obtain controlled U.S.-origin microelectronics, in part by misrepresenting that the end-users for the components were located in Estonia. \u00a0The components included dual-use programmable computer chips capable of operating in austere environments making them useful in both civilian and military applications. \u00a0Once in possession of the chips in Estonia, the co-defendants allegedly later smuggled them into the Russian Federation, in part by using laundered funds. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In sum, Kosmachov, Vetrov, and their two companies are charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(2)(A) and (h). \u00a0In addition, Kosmachov and Vetrov are charged with 12 substantive counts of violating the IEEPA, in violation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705, 19 counts of smuggling, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 554 and 2; and 17 counts of international money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>Kosmachov was arrested in Tallinn on September 12, 2018, and was extradited to the United States on March 14, 2019, to face prosecution. \u00a0Vetrov remains at large. \u00a0Kosmachov appeared this morning before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero, for a detention hearing. \u00a0He remains in federal custody pending his next court appearance. \u00a0Kosmachov is next scheduled to appear on March 28, 2019, before the Honorable William H. Orrick, U.S. District Judge, for further proceedings. \u00a0</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0If convicted, Kosmachov could face a maximum 20-year term of imprisonment for each IEEPA and money laundering-related count, and a maximum 10-year sentence for each count of smuggling. \u00a0Additional periods of supervised release, fines, and special assessments also could be imposed. \u00a0However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Philip J. Kearney of the Northern District of California United States Attorney\u2019s Office, and Amy Larson, of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, are prosecuting the case. \u00a0The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service with assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs.<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

Tse and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John Bennett. The sentence was handed down by the Honorable William H. Alsup, United States District Judge.</p>\n<p>Rood, 74, of Eureka, pleaded guilty to the charge on September 4, 2018. According to the plea agreement, Rood admitted he used publicly available computers at the Humboldt County Library to locate, view, and save images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Rood saved the images and videos to his personal email accounts and he also emailed the images and videos to his cellular phone. \u00a0Using email, Rood also traded images and videos of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct with others. He admitted that he possessed 230 images and 10 videos of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. \u00a0Some of the images and videos, Rood admitted, depicted sadistic or masochistic portrayals of minors as young as 5 years of age. \u00a0Further, Rood admitted he obtained and sent images to minors by email. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Rood on May 31, 2018, charging him with one count each of distribution, receipt and possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(2) and 2252(a)(4)(B). Pursuant to his plea agreement, Rood pleaded guilty to the possession charge and the remaining charges were dismissed. \u00a0The possession charge, in light of Rood\u2019s history, carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months in prison.</p>\n<p>In addition to the prison term, Judge Alsup sentenced the defendant to a 10-year period of supervised release.

The civil lawsuit was filed this morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned a multi-defendant indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company,\u201d said Attorney General Sessions. \u00a0\u201cMicron is worth an estimated $100 billion and has a 20 to 25 percent share of the dynamic random access memory industry\u2014a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently. \u00a0As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing\u2014and it has been increasing rapidly. \u00a0I am here to say that enough is enough. With integrity and professionalism, the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute such illegal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe theft of intellectual property is not only unfair, but stifles technological innovation by disincentivizing investment in long-term research and development. \u00a0The theft of intellectual property on a continuing basis by nation-state actors is an even more damaging affront to the rule of law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Alex Tse. \u201cWe in the Northern District of California, one of the world\u2019s great centers of intellectual property development, will continue to lead the fight to protect U.S. innovation from criminal misappropriation, whether motivated by personal greed or national economic ambition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"The attempts by foreign governments to illegally obtain U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets pose a substantial threat to our national security and economy,\" \u00a0said Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett. \u00a0 \"The San Francisco Bay Area, with its unique blend of human talent and innovative technologies, is often a target of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets by foreign individuals and governments. \u00a0This indictment demonstrates the FBI's commitment to protecting American innovation, research, and development.\"</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). \u00a0DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. \u00a0In the worldwide DRAM supply, Micron holds approximately a 20-25% of the market share. \u00a0Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM. \u00a0According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. \u00a0The indictment describes the manner and means by which the defendants conspired to steal Micron\u2019s intellectual property related to DRAM and convey it to a company controlled by the PRC government.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation (\u201cUMC\u201d), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. (\u201cJinhua'\u201d), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. \u00a0 UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, Calif. \u00a0UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. \u00a0UMC did not possess advanced DRAM technology prior to misappropriating it from Micron.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM. \u00a0The indictment describes how UMC, Jinhua, and employees of both, conspired to bypass many years of research and development by illegally obtaining Micron\u2019s proprietary technology. \u00a0The DRAM technology at issue is based on research and development and other proprietary information worth at least hundreds of millions and up to billions of dollars. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. \u00a0Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan (\u201cMMT\u201d), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron\u2019s DRAM chips. \u00a0Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC thereafter. \u00a0While at UMC, Chen helped negotiate a cooperation agreement between UMC and Jinhua whereby, with funding from Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Jinhua to mass-produce. \u00a0The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Jinhua. \u00a0Chen became the head of UMC\u2019s division tasked with fulfilling the terms of the cooperation agreement, namely developing DRAM technology to transfer to Jinhua. \u00a0Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility.</p>\n<p>While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. \u00a0Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. \u00a0For example, Ho and Wang stole confidential and proprietary materials pertaining to the past, current, and future generations of DRAM technology, some still in the research and development phase. \u00a0Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In sum, all defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a)(5); one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(5); and one count of economic espionage (receiving and possessing stolen trade secrets), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a)(3). \u00a0Additionally, Wang is charged with two counts of substantive economic espionage and Ho is charged with one count each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, the individual defendants face a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and a $5,000,000 fine for economic espionage charges, and 10 years imprisonment for theft of trade secrets charges. \u00a0If convicted, each company faces forfeiture and a maximum fine of more than $20 billion. \u00a0However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The defendants have been summoned to appear on November 19, 2018 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In the civil complaint, the United States sues UMC, Jinhua, and Chen to enjoin them from exporting to the United States any products containing DRAM manufactured by Jinhua or UMC. \u00a0The lawsuit also seeks an order preventing the civil defendants from transferring the trade secrets to anyone else. \u00a0As authority for the lawsuit, the complaint cites 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836(a), a statute that permits the Attorney General to \u201cobtain appropriate injunctive relief\u201d against violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1831 and 1832.</p>\n<p>This prosecution is a result of an investigation by the FBI. \u00a0Substantial assistance was provided by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Justice Investigation\u2019s Bureau, MJIB.<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

JHL is a company based in Zhubei, Taiwan, that develops \u201cbiosimilars.\u201d Biosimilars are roughly the equivalent of a \u201cgeneric\u201d chemical drug, i.e., designed to have properties similar to a biopharmaceutical that previously was approved by a regulatory agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0The indictment alleges Xanthe Lam conspired with Allen Lam and John Chan to steal the company\u2019s trade secrets related to biopharmaceuticals Pulmozyme, Rituxan, Herceptin, and Avastin. \u00a0Xanthe Lam allegedly downloaded, collected, and transferred to Allen Lam and others at JHL certain confidential Genentech documents relating to the processes by which the company formulated drugs and managed raw materials. \u00a0Xanthe Lam also allegedly secretly consulted for JHL while still employed at Genentech.</p>\n<p>The indictment also alleges that Xanthe Lam conspired with former Genentech employee James Quach to illegally use her computer credentials. \u00a0Specifically, she allowed Quach to gain access to Genentech\u2019s secure document repository and, once he had access to the repository, Quach stole the company\u2019s proprietary manufacturing protocols. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In sum, the Indictment charges the defendants with the following crimes and, if found guilty, they are subject to the following maximum statutory penalties:<br/>\n\u00a0</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p><b>Defendant</b></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><b>Age/Residence</b></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><b>Charges</b></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><b>Maximum Penalties</b></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Xanthe Lam</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>66/ South San Francisco, Calif.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01832(a)(5) \u2013 Conspiracy to Commit Theft of Trade Secrets</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1832(a) and 2 \u2013 Theft of Trade Secrets, Aid and Abet</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(b) \u2013 Conspiracy to Commit Computer Fraud and Abuse</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01030(a)(2)(C) and 2 \u2013 Computer Fraud and Abuse, Aid &amp;

DeMarchi today on charges of theft of trade secrets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832. \u00a0Zang entered a plea of not guilty at the hearing.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Zhang, 33, of San Jose, is alleged to have taken a confidential 25-page document containing detailed schematic drawings of a circuit board designed to be used in the critical infrastructure of a portion of an autonomous vehicle, knowing that the theft would injure the owner of the trade secrets, Apple, Inc. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Court documents filed in the case allege that on April 30, 2018, Zhang told Apple personnel that he was resigning from his job so that he could return to China to be closer to his mother who was ill. \u00a0Apple immediately terminated Zhang\u2019s access to its computer systems and Apple personnel began a forensic analysis of Zhang\u2019s Apple-owned devices and network activity. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to an affidavit filed in the case, Apple subsequently learned that Zhang went to work for X-MOTORS \u2013 a company focused on electric automobiles and autonomous vehicle technology with its headquarters in China. \u00a0Apple security personnel confirmed that in the three days prior to April 30, 2018, Zhang\u2019s network activity increased notably compared to the prior two years of his employment. \u00a0The majority of his activity consisted of downloading information from the project databases, and the downloaded information contained trade secret intellectual property.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On July 7, 2018, FBI Agents learned that Zhang purchased a last-minute round-trip airline ticket with no co-travelers, departing San Jose, Calif., on July 7, 2018, traveling to Beijing, China with a final destination of Hangzhou, China aboard Hainan Airlines.

Anderson issued the following statement:</p>\n<p>Today, the United States filed a motion to dismiss the criminal trade secret theft charges against Patrick Narron, Jing Qi Weiden, Patricia Romano, and Rong Zheng.\u00a0 The filing of this motion to dismiss follows the filing on December 11, 2019, of a similar motion to dismiss against Ana Rosario, and the return of not-guilty verdicts on February 3, 2020, by the trial jury of all charges against Katherine Mogal.\u00a0It is a serious step for the United States to move to dismiss criminal charges at any time, and more so without a presentation to a trier of fact and, as occurred here, after the pendency of charges for more than a year.\u00a0 However, it is the solemn duty of the United States to seek justice in all its cases, and to evaluate the appropriateness of charges at all times, not just at the point of indictment or trial.\u00a0 Our assessment of these cases led us to the firm conclusion that only an immediate dismissal of the criminal charges against all defendants would be in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>SAN JOSE \u2013 Six California residents were charged in a federal indictment filed today in San Jose, Calif., for their alleged possession of stolen trade secrets, announced Acting United States Attorney Alex G. Tse and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Spradlin. \u00a0The indictment charges each defendant with possession of one or more trade secrets. \u00a0The secrets allegedly were stolen from now-defunct San Francisco-based AliphCom, Inc., doing business as Jawbone, after his or her employment with Jawbone ended and the defendant accepted employment with Fitbit, Inc., another San Francisco-based company. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment charges Katherine Mogal, 52, of San Francisco; Ana Rosario, 33, of Pacifica; Patrick Narron, 41, of Boulder Creek; Patricio Romano, 37, of Calabasas; Rong Zhang, 45, of El Cerrito; and Jing Qi Weiden, 39, of San Jose, for being in possession of stolen trade secrets. The indictment describes Jawbone as a company that \u201cdesigned, manufactured, and sold wearable electronic devices, fitness trackers, and wireless speakers in interstate and international commerce.\u201d \u00a0The indictment alleges Jawbone\u2019s protected internal computer systems and cloud storage contained trade secrets, 14 of which are described in the indictment. \u00a0Similarly, the indictment describes Fitbit as a publically traded company that promotes itself as \u201cdesign[ing] products and experiences that track and provide motivation for everyday health and fitness.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, each of the defendants worked for Jawbone for at least one year between May of 2011 and April of 2015, and had signed a confidentiality agreement with the company. \u00a0The indictment alleges that in between March 2015 and April 2015, Mogal, Rosario, Narron, and Zhang, while still working for Jawbone, received an offer of employment from Fitbit and within three weeks, each had terminated his or her employment with Jawbone. \u00a0Each of these defendants accepted his or her offer of employment from Fitbit.

The third defendant, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, remains at large.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the indictment, the defendants operated cryptocurrency \u2018mixers\u2019 that served as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including the proceeds of ransomware and wire fraud,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent S. Wible, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. \u201cBy allegedly operating these mixers, the defendants made it easier for state-sponsored hacking groups and other cybercriminals to profit from offenses that jeopardized both public safety and national security. The indictment and arrests announced today, which follow the earlier takedown of the defendants\u2019 criminal infrastructure, yet again demonstrate the value of our international partnerships in countering the global threat from cybercrime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlender.io and Sinbad.io were allegedly used by criminals across the world to launder funds stolen from victims of ransomware, virtual currency thefts, and other crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia. \u201cThis indictment demonstrates our continued commitment to dismantling infrastructure used by cybercriminals to steal from Americans and hide their ill-gotten gains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year, with the assistance of our international partners, we successfully dismantled Sinbad.io,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Sean Burke of the FBI Atlanta Field Office. \u201cHowever, we did not rest with this initial success. We maintained our focus on identifying the individuals responsible for its development and ensuring their accountability. These indictments serve as a testament to the power of international cooperation.\u201d</p><p>According to court documents and publicly available information, Blender.io and Sinbad.io were cryptocurrency mixers that allowed their users, for a fee, to send cryptocurrency to designated recipients in a manner designed to hide the source of the cryptocurrency. Blender.io and Sinbad.io were available for use by the public via the internet and used by criminals looking to distance themselves from the fact that their funds came from cryptocurrency thefts, ransomware attacks, and other crimes.</p><p>Blender.io operated from approximately 2018 to 2022. The service was advertised on a popular internet forum as having a \u201cNo Logs Policy\u201d and deleting any traces of user transactions. Additionally, in the advertisement, Blender was described as not requiring users to sign up, register, or \u201cprovide any kind of detail except the receiving address!\u201d The advertisement asserted that, \u201c[a]s there are no personal details asked for, there\u2019s no way your identity is compromised, or can be linked back to, because as far as blender.io goes they don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d After Blender.io shut down, Sinbad.io began operating a few months later. Like Blender.io, Sinbad.io provided users with Bitcoin concealment services. And, on November 27, 2023, Sinbad.io was taken down through law enforcement action.</p><p>Both Blender.io and Sinbad.io have been sanctioned by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). On May 6, 2022, OFAC sanctioned Blender.io, citing its use by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to launder stolen virtual currency. OFAC\u2019s public sanctions announcement also explained that Blender.io laundered funds for multiple ransomware groups. On Nov. 29, 2023, OFAC sanctioned Sinbad.io, publicly citing its use by a DPRK state-sponsored hacking group and cybercriminals to obfuscate transactions linked to other criminal offenses.</p><p>Ostapenko, 55, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Oleynik, 44, and Tarasov, 32, are both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the money laundering conspiracy count and five years in prison for each unlicensed money transmitting business count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The Netherlands\u2019 Public Prosecution Service and Fiscal Information and Investigative Service made significant contributions to the case, including to the disruption of the Sinbad mixer, and provided other valuable assistance. Significant support was also provided by the Australian Federal Police and Attorney-General\u2019s Department, and Finland\u2019s National Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>The FBI is investigating the case.</p><p>Trial Attorney Ethan Cantor of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, who is a member of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal for the Northern District of Georgia are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and Assistant U.S. Attorney Maxwell Coll for the Central District of California provided significant assistance.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Do Hyeong Kwon, 33, a citizen of the Republic of Korea, was extradited from Montenegro and appeared in court today in Manhattan to face federal fraud charges. A <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2025-01/do_kwon_superseding_indictment.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">superseding indictment</a> that was unsealed against Kwon alleged that the co-founder and former chief executive officer of Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (Terraform) engaged in multiple schemes to deceive investors in order to fraudulently inflate the value of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Kwon arrived in the United States on Dec. 31, 2024, and made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger for the Southern District of New York. Kwon\u2019s case is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge John P. Cronan, and will appear before Judge Cronan for an initial conference on Jan. 8 at 10:30 a.m ET.</p><p>\u201cDo Hyeong Kwon will now be held accountable in an American courtroom for, as alleged in court documents, his elaborate schemes involving Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrencies, which resulted in over $40 billion in investor losses,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cWe secured this extradition despite Kwon\u2019s alleged attempt to cover his tracks by laundering proceeds of his schemes and trying to use a fraudulent passport to travel to a country that did not have an extradition treaty with the United States. This extradition from Montenegro is an example of the Justice Department\u2019s international partnerships, which enable the pursuit of criminals wherever they attempt to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA federal grand jury has indicted Do Kwon for misleading his investors in order to fraudulently inflate the value of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrencies, and laundering the proceeds of his crimes,\u201d said Attorney for the United States Daniel M. Gitner for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAs we allege, this fraud and the crash of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrencies in May 2022 erased over $40 billion in investor assets, causing devastating losses to countless investors in the United States and around the world. Kwon will now face justice in a federal courtroom in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo Kwon, co-founder and former CEO of Terraform, allegedly defrauded investors by falsely advertising the company\u2019s blockchain products as decentralized, reliable, and effective, and by engaging in market manipulation, ultimately resulting in more than $40 billion in investor losses,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy of the FBI New York Field Office. \u201cFor at least four years, Kwon allegedly played puppet master to maintain this crafted illusion and ensnare investors. The FBI will tirelessly work to apprehend any individual who engages in fraudulent financial practices, even those who flee internationally to escape prosecution.\u201d</p><p>As alleged in the superseding indictment, from at least in or about 2018, up to and including in or about 2022, Kwon orchestrated schemes to defraud purchasers of Terraform cryptocurrencies. Among other things, Kwon made false and misleading claims regarding the stability and efficacy of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrency stablecoin protocol, its use of blockchain technology, and its development of functioning and reliable financial technologies.</p><p>As Kwon knew, however, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon had claimed. Rather, Kwon manipulated Terraform products to create the illusion of a functioning, stable, and decentralized financial system. Kwon\u2019s conduct inflated the value of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrencies, which Kwon and entities he controlled possessed in large amounts and sold to investors in exchange for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of other assets.</p><p>Kwon\u2019s misrepresentations included the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The Stablecoin Misrepresentations</strong>: Kwon made misrepresentations about the effectiveness of the system that lay at the heart of Terraform\u2019s cryptocurrency empire, the \u201cTerra Protocol,\u201d which purportedly used a computer algorithm to maintain the value of Terraform\u2019s so-called \u201cstablecoin\u201d pegged to the U.S. dollar, TerraUSD (UST), at a value of $1 for one UST. But as Kwon knew, after the Terra Protocol failed to cause the restoration of UST\u2019s $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon reached an agreement with executives at a high-frequency trading firm (the Trading Firm) so that the Trading Firm would purchase large amounts of UST in order to artificially support UST\u2019s $1 peg.</li><li><strong>The LFG Misrepresentations</strong>: Kwon made misrepresentations about the governance of the Luna Foundation Guard Ltd. (LFG), which Kwon claimed was managed by an independent governing body and was tasked with deploying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of financial reserves to defend UST\u2019s peg. But as Kwon knew, he controlled both the LFG and Terraform. In addition, Kwon misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in assets from the LFG. Kwon and others acting at his direction sought to launder those misappropriated funds through transactions designed to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the funds.</li><li><strong>The Mirror Misrepresentations</strong>: Kwon made misrepresentations about the success and operation of an investing platform on Terraform\u2019s blockchain (the Terra blockchain) called Mirror Protocol (Mirror), that purportedly allowed users to create, buy, and sell synthetic versions of stocks listed on U.S. securities exchanges. Kwon claimed that Mirror operated in a decentralized manner and that he and Terraform played no role in Mirror\u2019s governance. But as Kwon knew, he and Terraform secretly maintained control over Mirror, and used automated trading bots to manipulate the prices of synthetic assets that Mirror issued. Kwon also caused Terraform to inflate key user metrics to deceive investors.</li><li><strong>The Chai Misrepresentations</strong>: Kwon falsely claimed that the Terra blockchain was being used to process billions of dollars in financial transactions for the Korean payment-processing application Chai. In doing so, Kwon claimed that the Terra blockchain had \u201creal world\u201d applications or uses, as distinct from competing cryptocurrency platforms. But as Kwon knew, Chai processed transactions through traditional financial processing networks, not the Terra blockchain.</li><li><strong>The Genesis Coin Misrepresentations</strong>: Kwon made misrepresentations about the use of a supply of one billion stablecoins programmed into the Terra blockchain at its creation (the Genesis Stablecoins), which were purportedly held in reserve for Terraform for certain specified uses. But Kwon used at least $145 million worth of Genesis Stablecoins, among other things, to fund fake Chai blockchain transactions and trading bots to manipulate the prices of synthetic assets that Mirror issued.</li></ul><p>At its peak in the spring of 2022, the total apparent market value of all UST and another Terraform cryptocurrency, LUNA, exceeded $50 billion. Much of this growth followed Kwon\u2019s misrepresentations about Terraform and its technology, including efforts in May 2021 by Kwon and his associates to secretly manipulate the market for UST. By May 2022, the UST market was approximately nine times larger in terms of market capitalization and more than eight times larger in terms of daily trading volume relative to May 2021. In May 2022, UST\u2019s peg began to break down as it had a year prior. While Kwon was able to cover up the weaknesses of the Terra Protocol in May 2021, he was not able to do so in May 2022. As a result, the value of UST and LUNA crashed and investors suffered over $40 billion in losses. After the crash of UST and LUNA in May 2022, Kwon caused the distribution of a misleading \u201cthird party audit\u201d report to cover up his crimes, and sought to launder the proceeds of his fraud through different blockchains, cryptocurrency exchanges, and a Swiss bank account.</p><p>On or about March 23, 2023, Kwon was arrested in Europe for trying to use a fraudulent passport to travel to a country that did not have an extradition treaty with the United States.</p><p>Kwon was previously charged in the Southern District of New York in an initial indictment on March 23, 2023.</p><p>Kwon is charged with two counts of commodities fraud, for which he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for each count; two counts of securities fraud, for which he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count; two counts of wire fraud, for which he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count; two counts of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, for which he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count; and one count of money laundering conspiracy, for which he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. If convicted of all charges, Kwon faces a maximum penalty of 130 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence based on the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The FBI are investigating the case, with assistance from Trial Attorneys Jason Cunningham and Goran Krnaich of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Interpol, and the Ministry of Justice, Supreme State Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Special State Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and Police Directorate of Montenegro in the extradition of the defendant. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also assisted in the case.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jared Lenow, Kimberly Ravener, and Andrew Thomas for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

Both men were arrested yesterday\u00a0by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)\u00a0in Los Angeles.</p><p>According to court documents, from May 2021 to May 2024, Gabriel Hay, 23, of Beverly Hills, and Gavin Mayo, 23, of Thousand Oaks, sponsored several NFT and other digital asset projects and undertook promotional activities in support of those projects. Hay and Mayo allegedly made or caused others to make materially false and misleading statements regarding the digital asset projects being launched and provided false and misleading project \u201croadmaps\u201d detailing plans for the NFTs or other digital asset projects after their launch that the sponsors never intended to fulfill. For example, the indictment alleges that in promoting the Vault of Gems NFT project, Hay and Mayo falsely claimed that the project would be the \u201cfirst NFT project to be pegged to a hard asset.\u201d However, instead of pursuing the Vault of Gems project or others as they had represented they would, Hay and Mayo allegedly abandoned the projects after collecting millions in funds from investors.</p><p>\u201cGabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes,\u201d said Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cFraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors\u2019 hard-earned money. The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor three years, Hay and Mayo apparently lied to their investors in order to defraud them out of millions of dollars,\u201d said HSI Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger. \u201cSuch technological fraud schemes cost investors millions of dollars every year. Just because such crimes aren\u2019t violent does not mean they are victimless. HSI will continue to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle such cryptocurrency fraud networks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever a new investment trend occurs, scammers are sure to follow,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central District of California. \u201cMy office and our law enforcement partners will continue our efforts to protect consumers and punish wrongdoers involved in crypto fraud.\u201d</p><p>Hay, Mayo, and others allegedly used these tactics with a variety of digital asset projects, including Vault of Gems, Faceless, Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, MoonPortal, Squiggles, and Roost Coin.\u00a0Hay and Mayo also allegedly used a variety of means to conceal their involvement in the fraudulent projects by falsely identifying other individuals or causing other individuals to be falsely identified as owners of the projects. When one project manager on the Faceless NFT project exposed Hay and Mayo as being behind that project, Hay and Mayo allegedly embarked on a harassment campaign against the project manager, sending or causing the sending of messages to the project manager and his parents for the purpose of intimidating him and his family and causing them great emotional distress.</p><p>Hay and Mayo are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each of the conspiracy and wire fraud counts and a maximum penalty of five years on the stalking count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>HSI Baltimore is investigating the case.</p><p>Trial Attorneys Tian Huang and Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section, both members of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), and Assistant U.S. Attorney Maxwell Coll for the Central District of California are prosecuting the case.</p><p>The NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that are enabling the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. The NCET also works to set strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identify areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and lead the department\u2019s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p><p>If you believe that you are a victim of any of the scams listed above or other scams involving the defendants, please email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:rugpullvictims@hsi.dhs.gov\">rugpullvictims@hsi.dhs.gov</a>.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

Sokoli is expected to be charged and prosecuted in Albania.</p><p>According to the indictment, the Rydox marketplace has conducted over 7,600 sales of personally identifiable information (PII), stolen access devices, and cybercrime tools, which generated at least $230,000 in revenue\u00a0since its inception in or around February 2016. These sales included PII, credit card information, and login credentials stolen from thousands of victims residing in the United States. In addition, the Rydox site has offered for sale at least 321,372 cybercrime products to over 18,000 users including stolen PII such as names, addresses, and social security numbers; access devices such as stolen credentials for online accounts and credit card information; and cybercrime tools such as scam pages, spamming logs, and spamming tutorials.</p><p>\u201cThe indictment alleges that, for more than eight years, the defendants administered an illicit online marketplace that sold PII, credit card information, and login credentials that had been stolen from thousands of U.S. victims,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cToday, we announce that, working with our domestic and foreign law enforcement partners, we have dismantled the marketplace, arrested its administrators, and seized their criminal proceeds.\u00a0This announcement is a powerful demonstration of the value of our partnerships on cybercrime, without which these arrests and seizures would not have been possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rydox marketplace was a one-stop shop where upwards of 18,000 of its cybercriminal customers could choose from more than 300,000 cybercrime tools,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Eric G. Olshan for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhile cybercrime often involves conduct occurring overseas and the actions of foreign nationals, its harms can be devastatingly local, with residents in our own communities suffering financial ruin as a result of the theft and misuse of their sensitive personal information. Today\u2019s takedown reinforces our steadfast message that the Western District of Pennsylvania and our domestic and international law enforcement partners will use every available tool to hold accountable those who pursue illicit profit at the expense of ordinary citizens around the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe success of this international operation underscores the power of collaboration between the FBI and our partners worldwide,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office. \u201cIt also serves as a clear warning: those who go after innocent people for financial gain will be pursued and brought to justice no matter where they are in the world. This operation marks a major blow against the criminal underground that seeks to profit from stolen information and fuels global cybercrime.\u201d</p><p>As part of the actions announced today, the United States also obtained judicial authorization to seize the domain www.Rydox.cc, which hosted and facilitated access to the Rydox website. The seizure of this domain by the government will prevent the owners and third parties from using the site to continue to buy and sell cybercrime tools and stolen personal information.

They used witting and unwitting \u201cmoney mules\u201d to receive fraud proceeds in their bank accounts and then either transferred those funds from the money mule accounts to accounts under the co-conspirators\u2019 control or converted the stolen proceeds to cash for further transfer. Over the years-long operation of the scheme, numerous victims were tricked into transferring funds into bank accounts the victims believed were under the control of legitimate recipients as part of normal business operations. In reality, the bank accounts were controlled by Osuji and his co-conspirators. The victims included a Connecticut-based financial company, a Colorado-based lending company, an Alaska-based nonprofit performing arts organization, a New York-based food and beverage company, and many others.</p><p>The scheme also involved the exploitation of elderly individuals through romance scams to serve as some of the unwitting money mules, including one woman who testified at trial that she was duped into sending her own personal savings and income, including Social Security checks, to an individual she believed to be her romantic partner, but who was in fact one of Osuji\u2019s co-conspirators. The scam resulted in the near-total depletion of her life savings, caused her to declare bankruptcy, and led to the repossession of her house. Her personal bank account was also used to facilitate the fraud against one of the companies targeted by Osuji.</p><p>Osuji was arrested in Malaysia and extradited to the United States in 2022. On May 1, 2024, a jury in New Haven found Osuji guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. As a result of the scheme, losses and intended losses totaled over $6 million. At his sentencing hearing, Osuji was ordered to pay restitution to his victims.</p><p>Osuji\u2019s alleged co-conspirator, John Wamuigah, remains in Malaysia and is pending extradition proceedings. An indictment is merely an allegation, and Wamuigah is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p><p>Another co-conspirator, Tolulope Bodunde, also a citizen of Nigeria, pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Oct. 16 to two years in prison.</p><p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery for the District of Connecticut; and Special Agent in Charge Robert Fuller of the FBI New Haven Field Office made the announcement.</p><p>The FBI New Haven Field Office and the Stamford Police Department investigated the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Royal Malaysia Police, and Malaysian Attorney General\u2019s Chambers provided valuable assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Osuji.</p><p>Trial Attorney Lydia Lichlyter of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Neeraj N.

Later that evening, Wimbish allegedly conducted online research to determine what information about himself would be publicly available. The following day, Wimbish allegedly mailed a letter addressed to the Jones County Elections Superintendent, purportedly from a \u201cJones County Voter.\u201d</p><p>The letter was allegedly drafted to make it appear as if it came from the voter, such as by stating that Wimbish had \u201cgive[n] me hell\u201d and that Wimbish was \u201cconspiring votes\u201d and \u201cdistracting voters from concentrating.\u201d The letter threatened that Wimbish and others \u201cshould look over their shoulder,\u201d that \u201cI know where they go,\u201d that \u201cI know where they all live because I found home voting addresses for all them,\u201d and that the \u201cyoung men will get beatdown if they fight me\u201d and \u201cwill get the treason punishment by firing squad if they fight back.\u201d Further, the letter allegedly threatened to \u201crage rape\u201d the \u201cladies\u201d and warned them to \u201cwatch every move they make and look over their shoulder.\u201d\u00a0The letter concluded with a handwritten note, \u201cPS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe.\u201d</p><p>The indictment alleges that Wimbish falsely told the FBI that he believed the Jones County voter he interacted with sent the letter and that he had not conducted online research on himself. The letter was found on Wimbish\u2019s computer.</p><p>Wimbish is charged with mailing a bomb threat, conveying false information about a bomb threat, mailing a threatening letter, and making false statements to the FBI. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the mailing a bomb threat count and five years in prison on each of the mailing a threatening letter, conveying false information, and making false statements counts.

The charges stem from their operation of 247TVStream, an online subscription-based service that permitted users to stream copyrighted content, such as live sports programming and television shows, without the permission of the relevant copyright owners.</p><p>According to court documents, Chowdhury and Rahman allegedly ran the illegal scheme for years and collected more than $7 million in subscriber fees from 247TVStream subscribers. The estimated harm to legitimate copyright owners caused by 247TVStream is more than $100 million. Chowdhury and Rahman also allegedly used a victim\u2019s identification to facilitate the infrastructure for the scheme.</p><p>The indictment was unsealed earlier today, following Chowdhury\u2019s arrest, and he appeared for his arraignment in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York this afternoon. An arrest warrant was issued for Rahman, who remains at large.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the indictment, Chowdhury and Rahman ran an illicit digital streaming site that infringed upon more than a hundred million dollars of intellectual property owned by legitimate copyright owners,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThanks to the work of our prosecutors, along with our domestic and international law enforcement partners, the illicit digital streaming site no longer exists, and Chowdhury is in custody. These actions demonstrate the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to protecting intellectual property rights by vigorously enforcing the laws against illicit digital transmission services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs alleged, the defendants operated a bootleg online streaming service that distributed copyrighted television programs that they stole for their personal enrichment,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cMy office and the Justice Department are committed to protecting the rights of intellectual property holders from digital pirates like these defendants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoor Nabi Chowdhury and Mohammad Rahman are accused of committing copyright infringement to the tune of over $100 million,\u201d\u00a0said Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker of the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York Field Office. \u201cAs alleged\u00a0and in furtherance of their criminal scheme, the defendants stole an unsuspecting victim\u2019s identity to exploit major American businesses, in pursuit of illicit wealth. HSI New York proudly stands alongside our law enforcement and private sector partners,\u00a0both domestic and abroad, to thwart criminal organizations who seek to financially capitalize on their wrongdoing.\u201d</p><p>Also today, HSI executed a seizure order from the Eastern District of New York against website domain names used by Chowdhury and Rahman to operate 247TVStream.\u00a0The seizure of these domains by the government will prevent the owners and third parties from using the sites to operate 247TVStream. Individuals, including subscribers, visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by the federal government. In addition, in coordination with international law enforcement partners to enforce criminal copyright laws, Dutch and United Kingdom authorities have seized the servers hosting a portion of the 247TVStream infrastructure.</p><p>If convicted, Chowdhury and Rahman each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison on the conspiracy to provide the illicit digital transmission service charge; three years in prison on the providing the illicit digital transmission service charge; 20 years in prison for the conspiracy to commit wire fraud charge; and a mandatory penalty of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft, to run consecutive to the other sentences.</p><p>The HSI New York Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from the HSI Buffalo Field Office and their Attach\u00e9 Offices in Ottawa, The Hague, and London.</p><p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also assisted. The Justice Department appreciates the additional assistance provided by the Surrey and City of London Police of the United Kingdom, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Fiscale inlichtingen- en opsporingsdienst of the Netherlands.</p><p>Trial Attorneys Vasantha Rao and Jeff Pearlman of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Schuman for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>After a two-week trial, a federal jury in Las Vegas yesterday convicted a Cuban citizen and U.S. permanent resident for helping operate an illegal streaming service with one of the largest quantities of infringing works. The defendant, who was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, is the eighth and final defendant to be convicted in the case.</p><p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial,\u00a0Yoany Vaillant, 43, worked as a computer programmer for Jetflicks,\u00a0an online, subscription-based service headquartered in Las Vegas that permitted users to stream and, at times, download copyrighted television episodes without the permission of relevant copyright owners.\u00a0At one point, Jetflicks claimed to have 183,285 different television episodes, far more than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, or any other licensed streaming service. At Jetflicks, Vaillant worked directly with Kristopher Dallmann and Jared Jaurequi, who were convicted of criminal copyright offenses by a different jury earlier this year.</p><p>According to his resume, Vaillant had 15 years of computer programming experience when he started at Jetflicks and knew 27 computer languages. During the four-and-a-half months that Vaillant worked at Jetflicks he made significant contributions to the operation of the service, including fixing issues affecting the automated downloading, processing, syncing, uploading, and streaming of Jetflicks\u2019 inventory of infringing television episodes.</p><p>Evidence at trial showed that Vaillant and his co-conspirators scoured the internet to find infringing television programs from pirate sites around the world \u2014 including some of the biggest sites specializing in infringing content such as The Pirate Bay, RARBG, altHUB, and Nzbplanet \u2014 using automated software and computer scripts that ran nonstop. Vaillant and his co-conspirators reproduced hundreds of thousands of copyrighted television episodes without authorization and streamed the infringing programs to tens of thousands of paid subscribers located throughout the United States, often providing episodes to subscribers the day after the shows originally aired on television. The vast scale of Jetflicks\u2019 piracy affected every significant copyright owner of a television program in the United States and resulted in millions of dollars of losses to the U.S. television show and streaming industries.</p><p>Vaillant was one of eight defendants indicted\u00a0in the Eastern District of Virginia in 2019 for running Jetflicks. In that case, Vaillant\u2019s co-defendant Darryl Polo, a computer programmer,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-computer-programmers-plead-guilty-connection-operating-two-biggest-illegal-movie-and\">pleaded guilty</a> to four criminal copyright counts and one money laundering count, which related to Jetflicks as well as another illegal streaming site he operated. Co-defendant Luis Villarino, also a computer programmer,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-computer-programmers-plead-guilty-connection-operating-two-biggest-illegal-movie-and\">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement at Jetflicks. The court sentenced Polo to four years and nine months in prison and Villarino to one year and one day in prison.</p><p>In February 2022, the court transferred the case to the District of Nevada for trial. The court in the District of Nevada subsequently severed Vaillant\u2019s case from the other remaining five defendants \u2014 Dallmann, Jaurequi, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, and Peter Huber \u2014 and those defendants were tried in Las Vegas last June. Dallmann ran the Jetflicks operation with assistance from Jaurequi and Courson; Garcia was in charge of customer support and helped obtain television show content; and Huber provided computer programming services. A jury found all five defendants\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-men-convicted-operating-major-illegal-streaming-service\">guilty</a> of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, and Dallmann was also found guilty of three additional counts of criminal copyright infringement and two counts of money laundering by concealment. This was the largest internet piracy case by volume of infringed works \u2014 and first illegal streaming case \u2014 ever to go to trial.</p><p>The court will sentence Dallmann, Courson, Garcia, Jaurequi, Huber, and Vaillant on Feb. 3 and 4, 2025. The court will determine any sentences after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Jason M. Frierson for the District of Nevada; and Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office made the announcement.</p><p>The FBI Washington Field Office investigated the case, with assistance from the FBI Las Vegas Field Office.</p><p>Senior Counsel Matthew A.

Garland. \u201cOver the past three and a half years, the Justice Department has been aggressively investigating and prosecuting those who threaten the public servants who administer our elections, and we will continue to do so in the weeks ahead. For our democracy to function, Americans who serve the public must be able to do their jobs without fearing for their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreats to election workers are threats to our democratic process,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.\u00a0\u201cNo one should face violence or threats of violence simply for doing their job. The actions announced today make clear that we will not tolerate those who use or threaten violence in an effort to undermine our democratic institutions. To carry out their essential work, election officials must be free from improper influence, physical threats, and others forms of intimidation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur elections are made possible by the hard work and patriotism of election workers in communities across the country who are also our neighbors, relatives and friends, and they deserve to do this important work without being subjected to threats,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe fact that election workers need to be worried about their security is incomprehensible and unacceptable. While these four cases are examples of the kinds of threats election workers are unfortunately facing, these cases also represent the FBI\u2019s dedication in holding accountable those who undermine our democracy with this conduct. The FBI and our partners on the ETTF will work tirelessly to charge and arrest those callous enough to make these threats and make sure they are held accountable. Free, fair, and safe elections are critical to our country and our democratic ideals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese defendants made serious threats of violence against members of the election community.\u00a0Threats like these strike at the very heart of our democracy,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe cases announced today underscore the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to defending our democracy, safeguarding our elections, and protecting all election workers. Through the ETTF, the Department will vigorously investigate and prosecute all criminal threats against members of the election community.\u201d</p><p>The four cases were all brought by the ETTF. Created by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and launched by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in June 2021, the task force has led the Department\u2019s efforts to address threats of violence against election workers, and to ensure that all election workers \u2014 whether elected, appointed, or volunteer \u2014 are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation. The task force engages with the election community and state and local law enforcement to assess allegations and reports of threats against election workers, and has investigated and prosecuted these matters where appropriate, in partnership with FBI Field Offices and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country. Three years after its formation, the task force is continuing this work and supporting U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and FBI Field Offices nationwide as they join the task force in its critical work.</p><p>Under the leadership of the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General, the task force is led by the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section (PIN) and includes several other entities within the Justice Department, including the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and FBI, as well as key interagency partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

On March 25, 2022, 17-year-old high school student, Jordan DeMay, of Marquette, Michigan, died as a result of this sextortion scheme, which targeted over 100 other victims.</p><p>\u201cThese defendants sexually exploited and extorted more than 100 victims, including at least eleven minors, resulting in the tragic death of a 17- year-old high school student,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThese sentences should serve as a warning that the perpetrators of online sexual exploitation and extortion cannot escape accountability for their heinous crimes by hiding behind their phones and computers. The Justice Department will find them, no matter where they are, and we will bring them to justice in the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing of Samuel and Samson Ogoshi sends a thundering message,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Mark Totten for the Western District of Michigan. \u201cTo criminals who commit these schemes: you are not immune from justice. We will track you down and hold you accountable, even if we have to go half-way around the world to do so. The day when you could commit these crimes, rake in easy cash, destroy lives, and escape justice is gone. And to parents, teenagers, and everyone who uses a cell phone: please, please be careful. These devices can connect you to criminal networks around the world. Don\u2019t assume people are who they say they are. Don\u2019t share compromising images. And if you\u2019re a victim, please reach out. There\u2019s help, and law enforcement stands ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sentencing of sextortionists Samuel and Samson Ogoshi ensures both international criminals will no longer victimize minors in the United States or throughout the world,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson of the FBI Detroit Field Office. \u201cSpreading awareness on sextortion is a top priority of the FBI here in Michigan. Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of Jordan DeMay and those affected by the criminal acts of these individuals.\u201d</p><p>At a press conference today, U.S. Attorney Totten emphasized the scope of this threat and the need for vigilance by sharing that multiple other deaths tied to sextortion schemes are under investigation in the Western District of Michigan.</p><p>As detailed in their plea agreements (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/media/1347471/dl?inline\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/media/1347461/dl?inline\">here</a>), Samuel and Samson Ogoshi engaged in a scheme while living in Nigeria to sexually exploit more than 100 victims, including at least 11 identified minor victims. They purchased hacked social media accounts and used them to pose as young women, making fake profiles and using the messaging feature on the social media accounts to contact victims. They conducted online research about their victims to learn where they lived, attended school, worked, and the identities of their family and friends. They then solicited their minor victims to produce sexually explicit images of themselves. Once they received the images, they created a collage of pictures that included the sexually explicit image with other images of the victim and their school, family, and friends. The Ogoshi brothers threatened to disclose the collages to the family, friends, and classmates of the victim unless the victim agreed to pay money using online cash applications.</p><p>In November 2022, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Michigan <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/2023_0503_Sextortion_Indictment\">charged</a> Samuel Ogoshi, Samson Ogoshi, and Ezekiel Robert, all Nigerian nationals, in the sextortion scheme that resulted in the death of Jordan DeMay. The Ogoshi Brothers were <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/2023_0813_Two_Nigerian_Men_Extradited_To_The_United_States\">extradited</a> to the United States in August 2023 and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/2024_0410_Ogoshi_Plea\">pleaded guilty</a> in April. On March 21, a Nigerian court ordered Robert to be extradited to the United States. He has appealed that decision, and the matter is before the Nigerian High Court.</p><p>In addition, on Aug. 2, U.S. Attorney Totten <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/2024_0802_Green_etal_Indictment\">announced</a> the unsealing of a federal indictment in a separate case charging five U.S.-based defendants with conspiring to commit money laundering that facilitated the sextortion scheme.\u00a0</p><p>The FBI, Marquette Sheriff\u2019s Department, and Michigan State Police Cybercrimes Unit in Marquette are investigating the case, with the cooperation and assistance of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria. The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Department of State, and Nigerian Attorney General\u2019s Office \u2013 Ministry of Justice provided critical assistance securing the arrest and extradition of the defendants.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Mekaru and Davin Reust for the Western District of Michigan are prosecuting the case.</p><p><strong><u>Safety Tips and Resources for Victims, Teens, and Parents</u></strong></p><p>The FBI provides the following tips on how people can protect themselves from sextortion schemes:</p><ol><li>Be selective about what you share online. If your social media accounts are open to everyone, a predator may be able to figure out a lot of information about you.</li><li>Be wary of anyone you encounter for the first time online. Block or ignore messages from strangers.</li><li>Be aware that people can pretend to be anything or anyone online. Videos and photos are not proof that people are who they claim to be. Images can be altered or stolen. In some cases, predators have even taken over the social media accounts of their victims.</li><li>Be suspicious if you meet someone on one game or app and that person asks you to start talking on a different platform.</li><li>Be in the know. Any content you create online \u2014 whether it is a text message, photo, or video \u2014 can be made public. And nothing actually \u201cdisappears\u201d online. Once you send something, you don\u2019t have any control over where it goes next.</li><li>Be willing to ask for help. If you are getting messages or requests online that don\u2019t seem right, block the sender, report the behavior to the site administrator, or go to an adult. If you have been victimized online, tell someone. Being a victim of sextortion is not your fault. You can get through this challenge, even if it seems scary and overwhelming. There are people who want to help.</li></ol><p>If you have information about or believe you are a victim of sextortion, contact your local FBI field office, call 1-800-CALL-FBI, or report it online at\u00a0<a href=\"http://tips.fbi.gov\">tips.fbi.gov</a>.

These emails falsely appeared as though they originated from trusted sources, such as a bank or a vendor. After the victim opened an attachment, their computers would be infected with malicious software, or \u201cmalware,\u201d that allowed the defendants and their co-conspirators to gain unauthorized access to the victim\u2019s computer systems and email accounts.

The defendant and his co-conspirators used various names for the sham companies, including Computer Run, EBooks, Joreeb, Memo Storage, Our Online Backup, You Can Fax Too and Your E-Library. These companies pretended to sell various internet-based services for consumers, such as cloud storage, internet faxing and online books. However, the sham companies did not actually provide any real products or services. Instead, the sham companies served to conceal the theft of money from bank accounts by Jannissar and his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Jannissar and his co-conspirators bought lists containing misappropriated personal information belonging to thousands of potential victims. Jannissar and his co-conspirators then falsely represented to banks and others that individual victims had authorized debits from their bank accounts. If the individual victims did not notice and dispute initial charges made by the sham companies, the sham companies would fraudulently debit bank accounts multiple times.

We thank our partners for their investigative efforts to help bring justice for victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Jannisar and his co-conspirators used sham companies to steal from unknowing victims by accessing their bank accounts using personal identifiable information from illegally obtained lists, and sadly nothing more than a keystroke on a computer,\u201d said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of U.S. Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigations (USPIS-CI). \u201cHis actions and those of his co-conspirators represent a crime of greed and opportunity but will not go unpunished thanks to the law enforcement community, who have dedicated their mission to uncovering and putting an end to devious schemes like these.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"The defendant's guilty plea holds him accountable for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme that stole funds from thousands of victims' bank accounts,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R.

Lin was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport on May 18, and will be presented in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Willis later today.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrug traffickers who think they can operate outside the law on the dark web are wrong,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAs alleged, Rui-Siang Lin was the architect of Incognito, a $100 million dark web scheme to traffic deadly drugs to the United States and around the world. The long arm of the law extends to the dark web, and we will bring to justice those who try to hide their crimes there.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint and the indictment, Incognito Market was an online narcotics bazaar that existed on the dark web. Incognito Market formed in October 2020. Since that time, and through its closing in March, Incognito Market sold more than $100 million of narcotics \u2014 including hundreds of kilograms of cocaine and methamphetamines. Incognito Market was available globally to anyone with internet access and could be accessed using the Tor web browser on the \u201cdark web\u201d or \u201cdarknet.\u201d Lin operated the Incognito market under the online pseudonym \u201cPharoah\u201d or \u201cfaro.\u201d As \u201cPharoah\u201d \u2014 the leader of Incognito market \u2014 Lin supervised all of its operations, including its employees, vendors, and customers, and had ultimate decision-making authority over every aspect of the multimillion-dollar operation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Rui-Siang Lin operated a sophisticated and dangerous online narcotics marketplace through which he profited millions of dollars at the community\u2019s expense,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cThe dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet. The so-called \u2018dark web\u2019 is not a safe haven for those who seek to break the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor nearly four years, Rui-Siang Lin allegedly operated \u2018Incognito Market,\u2019 one of the largest online platforms for narcotics sales, conducting $100 million in illicit narcotics transactions and reaped millions of dollars in personal profits,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge James Smith of the FBI New York Field Office. \u201cUnder the promise of anonymity, Lin\u2019s alleged operation offered the purchase of lethal drugs and fraudulent prescription medication on a global scale. The FBI is committed to targeting and dismantling all criminal enterprises, especially those whose leaders distribute illegal substances on the dark web.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Rui-Siang Lin\u2019s brazen operation resulted in the illicit sale of over $100 million in narcotics, including those that were mislabeled and later found to include deadly fentanyl,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ivan J. Arvelo of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s greed and disregard for others was further demonstrated by his alleged extortion attempt during the platform\u2019s final days. The El Dorado Task Force\u2019s Darkweb and Cryptocurrency Task Force leverages cutting-edge techniques to target even the Internet\u2019s most savvy criminals. HSI New York, in coordination with law enforcement partners, remains resolute in its commitment to protecting the public from individuals utilizing dangerous means to make a profit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe arrest of \u2018Incognito Market\u2019 owner Rui-Siang Lin is a result of the continued working relationship the DEA has with our law enforcement partners in targeting individuals who use the dark web as a marketplace to promote the sale of illicit narcotics,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Frank A. Tarentino III of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\u2019s New York Division. \u201cMr. Lin\u2019s alleged actions of putting profits before public health were not only reckless and dangerous, but unconscionable. We will continue to make sure those who hide behind a keyboard and use the dark web to profit off lives face justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FDA is committed to continuing its work to disrupt and dismantle the illegal sales of drugs on the dark web, where such sales far too often have tragic consequences,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Charles Grinstead of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) Kansas City Field Office. \u201cWe will continue to monitor, investigate, and bring to justice those who misuse the internet in a quest for profits with reckless disregard for the risk to public health and safety.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis arrest underscores the dedicated, ongoing efforts of law enforcement to identify and dismantle illicit drug networks operating from every shadowy recess of the marketplace,\u201d said Commissioner Edward A. Caban of the New York Police Department (NYPD). \u201cI commend our NYPD investigators and all of our state and federal partners for their unwavering commitment to public safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>Incognito Market was designed to foster seamless narcotics transactions across the internet and across the world and incorporated many features of legitimate e-commerce sites such as branding, advertising, and customer service. Upon visiting the site, users were met by a splash page and graphic interface, which is picture below:</p>\n<div>\n<div> <img alt=\"Incognito Market splash page and graphic interface\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/styles/banner/public/2024-05/lin_picture1.png?itok=L0B-GTuv\" title=\"Incognito Market splash page and graphic interface\" width=\"624\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>After logging in with a unique username and password, users were able to search thousands of listings for narcotics of their choice. Incognito Market sold illegal narcotics and misbranded prescription medication, including, heroin, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, oxycodone, methamphetamines, ketamine, and alprazolam. An example of listings on Incognito market is below:</p>\n<div>\n<div> <img alt=\"Incognito Market example listings\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/styles/banner/public/2024-05/lin_picture2.png?itok=NpOUBW7C\" title=\"Incognito Market example listings\" width=\"624\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Listings included offerings of prescription medication that was advertised as being authentic but was not. For example, in November 2023, an undercover law enforcement agent received several tablets that purported to be oxycodone, which were purchased on Incognito Market. Testing on those tablets revealed that they were not authentic oxycodone at all and were, in fact, fentanyl pills.</p>\n<p>Each listing on Incognito Market was sold by a particular vendor. To become an Incognito Market vendor, each vendor was required to register with the site and pay an admission fee. In exchange for listing and selling narcotics as a vendor on Incognito Market, each vendor paid 5% of the purchase price of every narcotic sold to Incognito Market. That revenue funded Incognito Market\u2019s operations, including paying \u201cemployee\u201d salaries and for computer servers. Lin collected millions of dollars of profits from Incognito. To facilitate these financial transactions, Incognito Market had its own \u201cbank,\u201d which allowed its users to deposit cryptocurrency on the site into their own \u201cbank accounts.\u201d After a narcotics transaction was completed, cryptocurrency from the buyer\u2019s \u201cbank account\u201d was transferred to the seller\u2019s \u201cbank account,\u201d less the 5% fee that Incognito collected. The bank enabled buyers and sellers to stay anonymous from each other. The bank\u2019s graphic interface is picture below:</p>\n<div>\n<div> <img alt=\"Incognito Market's bank graphic interface\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/styles/banner/public/2024-05/lin_picture3.png?itok=WD1rIGdF\" title=\"Incognito Market's bank graphic interface\" width=\"398\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If convicted, Lin faces a mandatory minimum penalty of life in prison for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise; a maximum penalty of life in prison for narcotics conspiracy; a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for money laundering; and a maximum penalty of five years in prison for conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI, HSI, DEA, FDA-OCI, and NYPD investigated the case.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan B. Finkel and Nicholas Chiuchiolo for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>This effort is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-drive, multi-agency approach.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>An indictment was unsealed in the Central District of California yesterday charging two Chinese nationals alleging they played leading roles in a scheme to launder proceeds from cryptocurrency investment scams.</p>\n<p>Daren Li, 41, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, and a resident of China, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates, was arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and subsequently transported to the Central District of California. Yicheng Zhang, 38, a Chinese national and resident of Temple City, California, was arrested yesterday in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>\u201cCryptocurrency investment scams exploit the borderless nature of virtual currency and online communications to defraud victims,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cWhile fraud in the crypto markets takes on many forms and hides in many far-off places, its perpetrators aren\u2019t beyond the law\u2019s reach. Today, we announce the arrests of two foreign nationals charged for leading a scheme to launder funds to the tune of at least $73 million tied to an international crypto investment scam. These arrests \u2014 made possible through the assistance of our international and U.S. partners \u2014 reflect the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing commitment to disrupting the entire cybercrime ecosystem and stopping fraud across all financial markets.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Li, Zhang, and other conspirators allegedly managed an international syndicate that laundered proceeds of cryptocurrency investment scams, which are also known as \u201cpig butchering.\u201d Victims of the schemes under investigation were fraudulently induced into transferring millions of dollars to U.S. bank accounts opened in the names of dozens of shell companies whose sole apparent purpose was to facilitate the laundering of fraud proceeds. A network of money launderers then facilitated the transfer of those funds to other domestic and international bank accounts and cryptocurrency platforms in a manner designed to conceal the source, nature, ownership, and control of the funds. The fraud scheme involved more than $73 million laundered through U.S. financial institutions to bank accounts in The Bahamas, and converted to the virtual asset USDT, or Tether. A cryptocurrency wallet involved in the scheme received more than $341 million in virtual assets.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Li and Zhang helped launder millions of dollars obtained from victims of cryptocurrency investment scams,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cMoney laundering is critical to the success of these scams, allowing fraudsters to quickly move illicit proceeds and try to make them appear legitimate. The arrests announced today demonstrate the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to disrupting the sophisticated financial networks on which these scams depend and holding those involved accountable, no matter where they may be found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSophisticated financial scams such as these are a dangerous threat to the financial wellbeing of all Americans,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central District of California. \u201cWhile my office will continue to root out and punish these deceitful schemes, I encourage everyone to educate themselves on pig butchering and other kinds of financial fraud to protect their families against such predatory activity. Vigilance is key.\u201d</p>\n<p>Li and Zhang allegedly instructed co-conspirators in the laundering network to open bank accounts in the names of various shell companies. Once the victims sent funds to the shell companies, Li and Zhang monitored the lower-level co-conspirators who transferred the proceeds overseas to bank accounts at Deltec Bank in The Bahamas. One of the Deltec Bank accounts was operated with the financial assistance of Li. The funds were then allegedly converted into cryptocurrency and sent to virtual-asset wallets, including at least one controlled by Li. Zhang allegedly also directly received victim funds.

Through the scheme, Kone, Outtara, and others attempted to extort approximately $6 million from thousands of potential victims and successfully extorted approximately $1.7 million from those victims, using CashApp and ApplePay accounts alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, Ouattara and others posed as young, attractive females online and initiated communications with thousands of potential victims, who were primarily young men and included minors from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. \u00a0Ouattara and others allegedly offered to provide and/or provided victims with sexual photographs, video recordings, and/or \u201cweb cam\u201d or \u201clive video chat\u201d sessions of what they falsely portrayed to be an attractive young female, when in fact they were the ones operating the accounts. Unbeknownst to the victims, during the web cam/live video chats, Ouattara and others surreptitiously recorded the victims as they exposed their genitals and/or engaged in sexual activity. Ouattara and others sent the victims copies of the victims\u2019 fraudulently obtained sexual images and threatened to distribute the victims\u2019 sexual images to the victims\u2019 friends, family members, significant others, employers, and co-workers and to publish the victims\u2019 sexual images widely online, unless the victims transferred funds to designated recipients. Ouattara, Kone, and others also operated infrastructure to transfer the funds illegally obtained from the victims to Ouattara and others located in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and elsewhere overseas.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 24, Ivoirian authorities separately arrested Ouattara in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, on Ivoirian charges stemming from the same scheme.</p>\n<p>Kone and Ouattara are each charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and to send interstate threats, conspiracy to engage in money laundering, money laundering, and wire fraud.

He has remained incarcerated in Peru since that time. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendant managed and operated Peruvian call centers from January 2014 through February 2019. The defendant and his co-conspirators in Peru allegedly used Internet-based telephone calls to contact Spanish-speaking individuals in the United States. The call centers falsely told victims they had won raffles for free products, including computer tablets with English language courses. Many consumers expressed interest in receiving the free products. In later calls, victims were told they were required to make large payments to receive the products. When victims objected, the callers misrepresented that the victims had unlawfully failed to pay for or receive delivery of products.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch will pursue and prosecute transnational criminals responsible for defrauding vulnerable U.S. consumers, wherever they are located. I thank the Republic of Peru, including the Peruvian National Police, for its assistance extraditing this individual to face charges here in the United States,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cThe Justice Department and U.S. law enforcement will continue to work closely with law enforcement partners across the globe to bring to justice criminals who attempt to defraud U.S. victims from outside the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCollaboration between countries enhances efforts to strengthen rule of law,\u201d said Inspector in Charge Juan A. Vargas of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Miami Division. \u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service thanks the Republic of Peru and our law enforcement partners who were determined to dismantle this transnational scheme to defraud U.S. consumers via the U.S. mail and telephonically. Together, we sent a strong message, globally, that justice has no borders.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the defendant and his co-conspirators falsely claimed to be lawyers, court officials, police officers, and representatives of a supposed \u201cminor crimes court.\u201d The defendant and his co-conspirators falsely told the victims that they had a contractual obligation to pay for and receive products and had caused legal problems for themselves and others by allegedly failing to do so. The indictment alleges that the callers also falsely threatened victims with court proceedings, arrest, negative marks on their credit reports, or immigration consequences if they did not immediately pay for the purportedly delivered products and settlement fees. According to the indictment, many victims paid because of these baseless threats.</p>\n<p>At times, the defendant and his co-conspirators re-victimized the same victims with a related \u201crestitution\u201d fraud scheme. According to the indictment, the defendant and his co-conspirators placed additional calls to those victims who had already paid and, while posing as lawyers from a U.S. court, falsely represented that victims were entitled to restitution payments that would compensate them for their losses to the defendant and his co-conspirators in the first part of their scheme. The defendant and his co-conspirators fraudulently told these victims that they needed to pay a percentage of their restitution to a lawyer who supposedly brought a case and recovered restitution on their behalf. In reality, there was no lawyer, no restitution order, and no funds were returned to the victims who made these additional payments. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A seven-count federal indictment was filed against the defendant in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in November 2021 and was unsealed upon the defendant\u2019s extradition to the United States. The defendant has been charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and extortion. An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. If convicted, Zu\u00f1iga faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>USPIS investigated the case.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of Florida, State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Peruvian National Police and the Peruvian Attorney General\u2019s Office provided critical assistance.</p>\n<p>Senior Trial Attorney and Transnational Criminal Litigation Coordinator Phil Toomajian and Trial Attorney Carolyn Rice of the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Justice Department continues to investigate and bring charges in other similar matters involving threats against Spanish-speaking residents of the United States.

Bankman-Fried, who was the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda Research, misappropriated billions of dollars of customer funds deposited with FTX, defrauded investors in FTX of more than $1.7 billion, and defrauded lenders to Alameda of more than $1.3 billion. Bankman-Fried was previously found guilty on two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, following a one-month trial before U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who imposed today\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are serious consequences for defrauding customers and investors,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, \u201cAnyone who believes they can hide their financial crimes behind wealth and power, or behind a shiny new thing they claim no one else is smart enough to understand, should think twice. I am grateful to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI for their outstanding work in bringing Mr. Bankman-Fried to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will aggressively investigate individuals, like Samuel Bankman-Fried, who engage in fraudulent schemes at the expense of the American public and our financial systems,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cWe are proud of the successful collaboration that ended this massive mismanagement and misappropriation of billions of dollars. Today's sentencing should serve as a warning to others looking to use fraudulent means for personal gain\u00a0\u2014 there are consequences for your actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamuel Bankman-Fried orchestrated one of the largest financial frauds in history, stealing over $8 billion of his customers\u2019 money,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cHis deliberate and ongoing lies demonstrated a brazen disregard for customers\u2019 expectations and disrespect for the rule of law, all so that he could secretly use his customers\u2019 money to expand his own power and influence. The scale of his crimes is measured not just by the amount of money that was stolen, but by the extraordinary harm caused to victims, who in some cases had their life savings wiped out overnight. As a result of his unprecedented fraud, Bankman-Fried faces 25 years in prison and forfeiture of over $11 billion dollars. Today\u2019s sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud and is an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift, and the consequences will be severe.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the indictment, the evidence offered at trial, and matters included in public filings:</p>\n<p>Samuel Bankman-Fried was the founder and chief executive officer of FTX, an international cryptocurrency exchange. From 2019 to 2022, Bankman-Fried was the leader and mastermind of a scheme to defraud customers of FTX by misappropriating billions of dollars of those customers\u2019 funds. Bankman-Fried took FTX customer funds for his personal use, to make investments and millions of dollars of political contributions to candidates from both parties, and to repay billions of dollars in loans owed by Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading fund that Bankman-Fried also founded. Bankman-Fried also defrauded lenders to Alameda and equity investors in FTX by providing them false and misleading financial information that concealed his misuse of customer deposits.</p>\n<p>Samuel Bankman-Fried repeatedly told his customers, his investors, and the public that customer deposits into FTX were kept safe and were held in custody for the customers, that customer deposits were kept separate from company assets, and that customer deposits would not be used by FTX. He also repeatedly claimed that his trading company, Alameda, did not have any privileged access to FTX and did not receive special treatment from FTX. Those statements were false, and Bankman-Fried in fact channeled billions of dollars in customer deposits from FTX to Alameda, and then used those funds to make investments for his own benefit, to make political contributions, and to spend on real estate, among other expenditures. He employed a variety of fraudulent means to perpetrate this fraud. For instance, Bankman-Fried directed co-conspirators to alter FTX\u2019s computer code to allow Alameda to withdraw effectively unlimited amounts of cryptocurrency from the exchange. Bankman-Fried also made false statements to financial institutions to conceal his misuse of customer dollar deposits. And he directed the creation of false financial statements for Alameda\u2019s lenders, inflated FTX\u2019s revenues and profits in numbers provided to investors, and backdated contracts and other documents to conceal his fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p>Judge Kaplan authorized the government to use the funds recovered through the forfeiture process to provide compensation to victims of Bankman-Fried\u2019s crimes.</p>\n<p>The FBI investigated the case.</p>\n<p>The Southern District of New York\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, with assistance from the office\u2019s Illicit Finance &amp; Money Laundering and Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Units are handling the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicolas Roos, Danielle Sassoon, Samuel Raymond, Thane Rehn, and Danielle Kudla are prosecuting the case.</p></div>",

The announcement was made by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland this afternoon while participating in a \u201cFireside Chat\u201d at the American Bar Association\u2019s 39th National Institute on White Collar Crime in San Francisco.</p><p>According to the indictment, returned on March 5 and unsealed earlier today, Ding, 38, a national of the People\u2019s Republic of China and resident of Newark, California, transferred sensitive Google trade secrets and other confidential information from Google\u2019s network to his personal account while secretly affiliating himself with PRC-based companies in the AI industry. Ding was arrested earlier this morning in Newark.</p><p>\u201cThe Justice Department\u00a0will not tolerate\u00a0the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,\u201d said Attorney General Garland. \u201cIn this case, we allege the defendant stole\u00a0artificial intelligence-related\u00a0trade\u00a0secrets from\u00a0Google while secretly working for two companies based in China. We will fiercely protect sensitive technologies developed in America from falling into the hands of those who should not have them.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhile we work to responsibly\u00a0harness the benefits of AI,\u00a0the Justice Department is on high alert\u00a0to its\u00a0risks, including\u00a0global\u00a0threats to\u00a0our national security,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s charges, the defendant stole\u00a0from Google\u00a0over 500 confidential files containing AI trade secrets, while covertly working for China-based companies seeking an edge in the AI technology race. The Justice Department will relentlessly pursue and hold accountable those who\u00a0would\u00a0siphon\u00a0disruptive technologies \u2013 especially\u00a0AI \u2013 for unlawful export.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s charges are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People\u2019s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe theft of innovative technology and trade secrets from American companies can cost jobs and have devastating economic and national security consequences. The FBI will continue its efforts to vigorously pursue those responsible for stealing U.S. companies\u2019 intellectual property and most closely guarded secrets.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Ding allegedly schemed to siphon off cutting-edge AI technology from Google while secretly trying to go into business with Chinese competitors,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThrough the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, we will work relentlessly to find and hold accountable those who would steal advanced American technology and jeopardize our national security and economic prosperity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Linwei Ding was employed as a software engineer at Google, he was secretly working to enrich himself and two companies based in the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey. \u201cBy stealing Google\u2019s trade secrets about its artificial intelligence supercomputing systems, Ding gave himself and the companies that he affiliated with in the PRC an unfair competitive advantage.\u00a0 This office is committed to protecting the innovation of our Silicon Valley companies. To that end, we will aggressively investigate and prosecute the theft of sensitive trade secrets by insiders like Ding, including criminal efforts to jump start illegitimate competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the one year since its inception, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force has been relentless in\u00a0protecting advanced U.S. technologies, like artificial intelligence, from malign actors,\u201d said Assistant Secretary Matthew S. Axelrod of the Commerce Department\u2019s Office for Export Enforcement. \u201cLet today\u2019s announcement serve as further warning \u2013 those who would steal sensitive U.S. technology risk finding themselves on the wrong end of a criminal indictment.\u201d</p><p>According to court documents, the technology Ding allegedly stole involves the building blocks of Google\u2019s advanced supercomputing data centers, which are designed to support machine learning workloads used to train and host large AI models. According to the indictment, large AI models are AI applications capable of understanding nuanced language and generating intelligent responses to prompts, tasks, or queries. The indictment describes how Google developed both proprietary hardware and software to facilitate the machine learning process powered by its supercomputing data centers. With respect to hardware, Google uses advanced computer chips with the extraordinary processing power required to facilitate machine learning and run AI applications. With respect to software, Google deploys several layers of software, referred to in the indictment as the \u201csoftware platform,\u201d to orchestrate machine learning workloads efficiently. For example, one component of the software platform is the Cluster Management System (CMS), which functions as the \u201cbrain\u201d of Google\u2019s supercomputing data centers. The CMS organizes, prioritizes, and assigns tasks to the hardware infrastructure, allowing the advanced chips to function efficiently when executing machine learning workloads or hosting AI applications.</p><p>According to the indictment, Google hired Ding as a software engineer in 2019. Ding\u2019s responsibilities included developing the software deployed in Google\u2019s supercomputing data centers. In connection with his employment, Ding was granted access to Goggle\u2019s confidential information related to the hardware infrastructure, the software platform, and the AI models and applications they supported. The indictment alleges that on May 21, 2022, Ding began secretly uploading trade secrets that were stored in Google\u2019s network by copying the information into a personal Google Cloud account. According to the indictment, Ding continued periodic uploads until May 2, 2023, by which time Ding allegedly uploaded more than 500 unique files containing confidential information.</p><p>In addition, the indictment alleges that Ding secretly affiliated himself with two PRC-based technology companies. According to the indictment, on or about June 13, 2022, Ding received several emails from the CEO of an early-stage technology company based in the PRC indicating Ding had been offered the position of Chief Technology Officer for the company. Ding allegedly traveled to the PRC on Oct. 29, 2022, and remained there until March 25, 2023, during which time he participated in investor meetings to raise capital for the new company. The indictment alleges potential investors were told Ding was the new company\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and that Ding owned 20% of the company\u2019s stock.</p><p>According to the indictment, unbeknownst to Google, by no later than May 30, 2023, Ding had founded his own technology company in the AI and machine learning industry and was acting as the company\u2019s CEO. Ding\u2019s company touted the development of a software platform designed to accelerate machine learning workloads, including training large AI models. As alleged in the indictment, Ding applied to a PRC-based startup incubation program and traveled to Beijing, to present his company at an investor conference on Nov. 24, 2023. As set forth in the indictment, a document related to Ding\u2019s startup company stated, \u201cwe have experience with Google's ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it - and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China's national conditions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The indictment alleges Ding\u2019s conduct violated his employment agreement as well as a separate code of conduct that Ding signed when he became a Google employee. Further, the indictment describes measures that Ding allegedly took to conceal his theft of the trade secrets. For example, he allegedly copied data from Google source files into the Apple Notes application on his Google-issued MacBook laptop. By then converting the Apple Notes into PDF files and uploading them from the Google network into as separate account, Ding allegedly evaded detection by Google\u2019s data loss prevention systems. Likewise, the indictment describes how in December 2023 Ding allegedly permitted another Google employee to use his Google-issued access badge to scan into the entrance of a Google building \u2013 making it appear he was working from his U.S. Google office when, in fact, he was in the PRC.</p><p>Ding is charged with four counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, Ding faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine for each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The FBI and Commerce Department are investigating the case.</p><p>The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California and Justice Department National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p><p>Today\u2019s action was coordinated through the Justice and Commerce Departments\u2019 Disruptive Technology Strike Force. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation-states.</p><p><em>An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</em></p></div>",

After referencing claims of voter fraud in Arizona\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial race, Ogstad allegedly made a number of threats to election workers and officials, including that they were \u2018dead\u2019 and \u2018stupid if you think your lives are safe,\u2019\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cPublic servants who administer our elections \u2014 the cornerstone of our democracy \u2014 must be able to do their jobs without fear. The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute those who target election officials and workers with threats of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to an indictment unsealed today, on or about Aug. 2, 2022, Arizona held primary elections for federal and state officeholders, including a gubernatorial primary election that received nationwide media coverage. From the day of the election through on or about Aug. 4, 2022, Ogstad allegedly sent multiple threatening direct messages to an Instagram social media account maintained by Maricopa County Elections. For instance, on or about Aug. 3, 2022, Ogstad allegedly stated (1) \u201cYou did it! Now you are [expletive]. Dead. You will all be executed for your crimes\u201d; (2) \u201c[expletive] you!

Today, the Department continues that work through significant enforcement actions in five separate federal cases against sanctioned oligarchs and facilitator networks supporting the Russian regime.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s actions coincide with the approaching two-year mark of Russia\u2019s unprovoked war in Ukraine. Read more about the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to hold Russia accountable <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1339326/dl?inline\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Justice Department is more committed than ever to cutting off the flow of illegal funds that are fueling Putin\u2019s war and to holding accountable those who continue to enable it,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThat is why today we are announcing several additional enforcement actions that the Justice Department has taken to bring prosecutions against and seize assets of sanctioned enablers of the Kremlin and Russian military.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince the onset of Russia\u2019s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Justice Department has used every tool in our arsenal \u2013 including our international partnerships \u2013 to target the criminal actors and activity propping up Vladimir Putin, his henchmen, and his illegal war,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cOver the last two years, our Task Force KleptoCapture has restrained, seized, and obtained judgments to forfeit\u00a0nearly $700 million in assets from Russian enablers and charged more than 70 individuals for violating international sanctions and export controls levied against Russia. The charges we announce today against oligarchs, facilitators, and money launderers are the next chapter: so long as Russia's aggression continues, so too will our resolve to hold its enablers accountable. We stand firmly with the people of Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been two years since Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the FBI continues to go after the Russian criminals who finance and enable Russia\u2019s war,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cTo the people of Ukraine fighting for their freedom: The FBI remains steadfast in our efforts to disrupt and hold accountable the criminals supporting the Russian War, and we will continue to stand with you to fend off Russian aggression for as long as it takes.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the Southern District of New York, the Department unsealed charges against three people, including sanctioned oligarch Andrey Kostin and two of his U.S.-based facilitators. The facilitators, Vadim Wolfson, aka Vadim Belyaev and Gannon Bond, were arrested today.</p>\n<p>In the Middle District of Florida, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Sergey Vitalievich Kurchenko, a sanctioned pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch, in a years-long scheme to violate and evade U.S. sanctions by receiving funds from and doing approximately $330 million in business with U.S. persons.</p>\n<p>In the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta-based dual national Feliks Medvedev pleaded guilty to his role in laundering over $150 million through bank accounts and shell companies on behalf of Russian clients.

The indictment alleges that the defendant accused the official of cheating the election and told the official to \u2018run\u2019 and \u2018hide,\u2019\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe Criminal Division is committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting individuals who threaten election officials. We will not tolerate criminal intimidation of those who administer and safeguard our elections.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to an indictment unsealed today, on or about Nov. 28, 2022, a victim election official attended a meeting of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, where the Board of Supervisors certified the 2022 general election results in Maricopa County. The following day, Hyde allegedly left the following voicemail message on the personal cell phone of the election official: \u201cRun, [expletive].\u201d Approximately one minute later, Hyde allegedly left the following voicemail message on the personal cell phone of the election official: \u201cYou wanna cheat our elections? You wanna screw Americans out of true votes? We\u2019re coming, [expletive]. You\u2019d better [expletive] hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIntimidation of election officials strikes at the very heart of our democracy,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath for the Southern District of California. \u201cEven just one case can have a ripple effect.\u00a0 This office will aggressively prosecute any attempt to intimidate, threaten, or frighten election officials as they engage in these critical duties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElection integrity starts with protecting those we entrust to administer elections,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Gary M. Restaino for the District of Arizona. \u201cWe appreciate the admirable efforts of the Recorder\u2019s Office and Elections Department in Maricopa County to efficiently register Arizonans as eligible voters, and to accurately and transparently tabulate their votes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndividuals who work to ensure the integrity of our elections should not have to worry about their safety while working for the American people,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge TJ Holland of the FBI San Diego Field Office. \u201cWe will continue to collaborate with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to protect election officials and prosecute anyone who threatens to harm them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hyde is charged with one count of communicating an interstate threat.

Announced by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and launched by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in June 2021, the task force has led the department\u2019s efforts to address threats of violence against election workers, and to ensure that all election workers \u2013 whether elected, appointed, or volunteer \u2013 are able to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation. The task force engages with the election community and state and local law enforcement to assess allegations and reports of threats against election workers, and has investigated and prosecuted these matters where appropriate, in partnership with FBI Field Offices and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country. A year after its formation, the task force is continuing this work and supporting the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and FBI Field Offices nationwide as they carry on the critical work that the task force has begun.</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Deputy Attorney General Monaco, the task force is led by the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section and includes several other entities within the Justice Department, including the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and FBI, as well as key interagency partners, such as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

Zhang and Walker were arrested and made their initial appearances in federal court yesterday.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Zhang, Walker, Wong, and Zhu allegedly conspired to open shell companies and bank accounts to launder victim proceeds of cryptocurrency investment scams, also known as \u201cpig butchering,\u201d and other fraudulent schemes. They transferred the funds to domestic and international financial institutions. The overall fraud scheme in the related pig-butchering syndicate involved at least 284 transactions and resulted in more than $80 million in victim losses. More than $20 million in victim funds were directly deposited into bank accounts associated with the defendants.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, \u201cpig butchering\u201d fraud schemes (a term derived from a foreign-language phrase used to describe these crimes) consist of scammers encountering victims on dating services, social media, or through unsolicited messages or calls, often masquerading as a wrong number. Scammers initiate relationships with victims and slowly gain their trust, eventually introducing the idea of making a business investment using cryptocurrency. Victims are then directed to other members of the scheme operating fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platforms and applications, where victims are persuaded to make financial investments. Once funds are sent to scammer-controlled accounts, the investment platform often falsely shows significant gains on the purported investment, and the victims are thus induced to make additional investments. Ultimately, the victims are unable to withdraw or recover their money, often resulting in significant losses for the victims.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Zhang and Walker face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M.

The charges include torture, inhuman treatment, and unlawful confinement of a U.S. national in Ukraine following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>\n<p>Suren Seiranovich Mkrtchyan, 45, Dmitry Budnik, Valerii LNU (last name unknown), and Nazar LNU were each charged in connection with their unlawful detainment of a U.S. national in the context of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The defendants are alleged to have interrogated, severely beaten, and tortured the victim. They also allegedly threatened to kill the victim and conducted a mock execution.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the world has witnessed the horrors of Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine, so has the United States Department of Justice,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThat is why the Justice Department has filed the first ever charges under the U.S. war crimes statute against four Russia- affiliated military personnel for heinous crimes against an American citizen. The Justice Department will work for as long as it takes to pursue accountability and justice for Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks to the tireless and unprecedented work of federal law enforcement agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Justice Department, four Russian soldiers, accused of unthinkable, unacceptable human rights violations against an American citizen, have been charged with war crimes and will be brought to justice,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cThe indictments unsealed today send a clear message to Russia \u2013 our government will spare no effort and spare no resource to hold accountable those who violate the fundamental human rights of an American.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince the start of their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russia has weaponized human rights abuses to wreak unimaginable tragedy,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment \u2013 the first ever under the U.S. war crimes statute \u2013 makes clear that the FBI will work with the full cooperation of international law enforcement to bring justice to the victims of these atrocities. The human toll of the conflict in Ukraine weighs heavily on the hearts of the FBI, and we\u2019re resolved to hold war criminals accountable no matter where they are or how long it takes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTorturing and unlawfully confining a protected person are serious human rights abuses that must not go unpunished,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0\u201cThese historic criminal charges \u2013 the first ever brought under the U.S. war crimes statute \u2013 are an important step in the Justice Department\u2019s continuing efforts to pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to allegations in the indictment, Mkrtchyan and Budnik were commanding officers of military units of the Russian Armed Forces and/or the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, and Valerii and Nazar were lower-ranking military personnel. The defendants are alleged to have been fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine when they allegedly committed war crimes.</p>\n<p>In April 2022, Mkrtchyan and soldiers under his command allegedly abducted the victim, a U.S. national, from his home in the village of Mylove in the Kherson Oblast region in southern Ukraine and unlawfully confined him for at least 10 days. During the abduction, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others allegedly threw the victim face down to the ground while he was naked, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and severely beat him, including with the stocks of their guns. Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others then allegedly transported the victim to an improvised military compound in Mylove.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese charges reflect that the defendants\u2019 alleged actions are not only grave breaches of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, but also violations of U.S. law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cWe are proud to be at the forefront of the Justice Department\u2019s effort to hold perpetrators of war crimes violations accountable in Ukraine and will continue to pursue them. We thank our investigative partners on this case, the War Crimes Accountability Team, the FBI Washington Field Office, and Homeland Security Investigations for their outstanding efforts to gather evidence required for these charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment also alleges that Mkrtchyan and Budnik led and participated in at least two interrogation sessions during which the four defendants and others tortured the victim. During one interrogation, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, and Nazar allegedly stripped off the victim\u2019s clothes and photographed him. The defendants and others then allegedly severely beat the victim, pointed guns at the back of his head, and threatened to shoot him. Budnik allegedly threatened the victim with death and asked for his last words. Shortly thereafter, Nazar and others allegedly conducted a mock execution. They allegedly forced the victim to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head, then moved the gun slightly and shot a bullet just past the victim\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese historic charges are the culmination of a complex investigation by the FBI and our partners that spans the globe,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office. \u201cThe FBI will continue to work alongside our domestic and international partners to pursue justice and hold those accountable who commit such atrocities against others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActing on behalf of the Russian Armed Forces and the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, these four individuals allegedly violated the human rights of an American citizen,\u201d said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\u00a0 \u201cAccording to the charges, they unlawfully detained and tortured the American citizen, and even went so far as to carry out a mock execution. The unsealing of these charges for war crimes is an important step in bringing the responsible parties to justice. HSI will continue to aggressively pursue anyone who violates the human rights of our American citizens \u2013 at home or overseas.\u201d</p>\n<p>The defendants are charged with three war crimes \u2013 unlawful confinement, torture, and inhuman treatment \u2013 and one count of conspiracy to commit war crimes. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of life in prison.</p>\n<p>The FBI Washington Field Office and HSI Washington, D.C., Field Office, with assistance from the FBI\u2019s International Human Rights Unit and HSI\u2019s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, investigated the war crimes allegations in partnership with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Justice Department\u2019s War Crimes Accountability Team, which is based in the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.</p>\n<p>HRSP Trial Attorney and Lead Prosecutor for the War Crimes Accountability Team Christian Levesque, HRSP Trial Attorney Patrick Jasperse, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander E. Blanchard for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas W. Traxler for the Eastern District of Virginia.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Justice Department, along with the Department of Homeland Security and its partners, today announced significant sentences obtained through Joint Task Force Alpha\u2019s (JTFA) prosecution of leaders, organizers, and members of a prolific human smuggling scheme that resulted in the death of a Guatemalan migrant in 2021.</p>\n<p>Four defendants were sentenced today in the Western District of Texas for their roles in the human smuggling scheme. Lopez Mateo Mateo, aka Bud Light, 43, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; Felipe Diego Alonzo, aka Siete, 40, was sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison; and Nesly Norberto Martinez Gomez, aka Canche, 38, and Juan Gutierrez Castro, aka Andres, 46, were both sentenced to 10 years and one month in prison.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe four defendants sentenced in this case were part of a deadly human smuggling operation that endangered vulnerable migrants for profit and cost one woman her life,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cWhen I directed the formation of Joint Task Force Alpha in 2021, I said that the Justice Department would combat the threats posed by dangerous human smuggling networks where they originate and operate. Since then, the Justice Department has made over 260 domestic and international arrests and secured 150 convictions on human smuggling charges. The Justice Department will continue to disrupt and dismantle the threat posed by human smuggling and trafficking operations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuman smugglers will do anything to make a profit and the Department of Homeland Security will do everything in its power to stop them,\u201d said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cThe sentencing of these four individuals is the direct result of an unprecedented, whole-of-government effort to prevent these crimes and seek justice for victims. In close partnership with the Justice Department and others through JTFA, our Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents will continue to investigate and dismantle the transnational criminal organizations that prey on vulnerable people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTragedies like this serve as a stark reminder of the dangers human smugglers pose to migrants,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u00a0\u201cJoint Task Force Alpha, with our international law enforcement partners, will continue to pursue and take down dangerous transnational operations that undermine our lawful immigration system and exploit migrants in the name of profit.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, the defendants admitted to conspiring with other smugglers to facilitate the movement of large numbers of migrants from Guatemala through Mexico and ultimately into the United States. They charged the migrants and their families approximately $10,000 to $12,000 for the perilous journey. One of the journeys resulted in the death of a young indigenous Guatemalan woman, who died in Texas in April 2021. The woman\u2019s family paid the defendants approximately $10,000 to smuggle her into the United States. The defendants arranged for her to be guided for several days on foot through the desert from Mexico into Texas and then driven to a stash house in Odessa, Texas, where she ultimately died. The defendants and their co-conspirators dumped her body on the side of a rural road outside Odessa, Texas. The defendants and their co-conspirators also arranged to pay off the victim\u2019s family in Guatemala.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese sentences reflect the lengths and degrees this office and the overall Justice Department will go to seek justice for the victims of heinous crimes and prevent further harm,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas. \u201cSmuggling rings like these operate, not with any concern for their victims\u2019 lives, but rather their greed and desire for cold, hard cash. In coordination with our partners, both in the United States and worldwide, we will continue to do everything in our power to dismantle these networks and hold smugglers accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHSI will continue to apply its broad investigative authority and international footprint to ensure members of these transnational criminal networks are held accountable for preying upon and abusing a vulnerable population,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Francisco B. Burrola of HSI El Paso. \u201cOur message is clear: If you\u2019re running one of these elicit organizations that are moving human cargo, we will find you no matter how near or far you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to bring an alien to the United States resulting in death. As <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-guatemalan-nationals-indicted-joint-task-force-alpha-and-arrested-part-takedown-deadly\">announced last year</a>, extensive coordination between U.S. and Guatemalan law enforcement authorities led to the indictment and arrest of these four defendants, as well as the apprehension of 15 additional co-conspirators in Guatemala. Pursuant to an extradition request, in March, Guatemalan authorities extradited Mateo Mateo, Diego Alonzo, Martinez Gomez, and Gutierrez Castro to the United States \u2013 the first Guatemalan human smuggling extraditions to the United States in nearly five years, and the first ever extraditions from Guatemala to the United States on charges of human smuggling resulting in death.</p>\n<p>HSI Midland led the investigation, working in concert with HSI Guatemala and the HSI Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C. HSI received substantial assistance from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations; ICE\u2019s Parole and Law Enforcement Programs Unit; U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s National Targeting Center/Operation Sentinel; U.S. Border Patrol; U.S. Marshals Service; the Odessa and Midland Police Departments; the Texas Department of Public Safety; and the Ector County, Midland County, and Crane County Sheriffs\u2019 Offices.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs (OIA) provided significant assistance to secure the arrest and extradition of the four defendants. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT) provided case-based mentoring to support the investigation. The Justice Department is grateful to Guatemalan law enforcement, who were instrumental in furthering this investigation.</p>\n<p>JTFA Co-Director James Hepburn of the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jose Luis Acosta and John Fedock for the Western District of Texas prosecuted the case, with substantial assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Adrian Gallegos for the Western District of Texas and HRSP Historian and Latin America Specialist Joanna Crandall.</p>\n<p>This prosecution and the collaboration with Guatemalan law enforcement were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). Attorney General Garland created JTFA in June 2021 in partnership with DHS to strengthen the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to combat the rise in prolific and dangerous smuggling emanating from Central America and impacting our border communities. JTFA is comprised of detailees from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices along the southwest border, including the Southern District of Texas, the Western District of Texas, the District of New Mexico, the District of Arizona, and the Southern District of California. Dedicated support is also provided by numerous components of the Criminal Division that are part of JTFA, led by HRSP, and supported by ODPAT, the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, OIA, and the Violent Crime and Racketeering Section. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and other partners.\u00a0 To date, JTFA\u2019s work has resulted in over 260 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of human smuggling; over 150 convictions; significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.\u00a0</p></div>",

Kuhlmeyer wrote many of the stories himself but also published the works of other offenders, including stories that had been previously published on Mr. Double, another website dedicated to publishing writings that detail the sexual abuse of children.

The indictment alleges that between 2016 and 2018, Savariau conspired with others to profit from fees paid by victims of fraudulent debt relief companies. The indictment alleges that conspirators created and operated fraudulent businesses and websites that marketed and sold fraudulent debt relief services to members of the public. Conspirators fraudulently misrepresented that members of the public could apply for and obtains thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of debt relief on their outstanding, unpaid bills in the form of grants, all in exchange for payment of a service processing fee. Conspirators also claimed that the purported debt relief was funded and administered by the U.S. government.

Garland. \u201cThe efforts announced today reflect the commitment of the Justice Department and our law enforcement and regulatory partners to advancing the responsible development of digital assets, protecting the public from criminal actors in this ecosystem, and meeting the unique challenges these technologies pose.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>As noted in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">White House Fact Sheet</a>, these efforts are part of a larger, collaborative effort across government agencies \u201cto develop frameworks and policy recommendations that advance six key priorities identified in the EO: consumer and investor protection; financial stability; illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion;\u00a0and responsible innovation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDevelopments in digital assets have created a new landscape for criminals to exploit innovation to further significant criminal and national security threats domestically and abroad,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThrough the creation of the DAC Network, the Criminal Division and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team will continue to ensure that the Department and its prosecutors are best positioned to combat the ever-evolving criminal uses of digital asset technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>First, in response to the March 9 Executive Order, the department\u2019s report discusses the manner in which illicit actors are exploiting digital asset technologies; the challenges that digital assets pose to criminal investigations; initiatives that the department and law enforcement agencies have established as part of whole-of-government efforts to more effectively detect, investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt these crimes; and recommended regulatory and legislative actions to further enhance law enforcement\u2019s ability to address digital asset crimes.</p>\n<p>Second, the department\u2019s Criminal Division has launched the DAC. Led by the department\u2019s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), the DAC Network comprises over 150 designated federal prosecutors from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and across the department\u2019s litigating components, and will serve as the department\u2019s primary forum for prosecutors to obtain and disseminate specialized training, technical expertise, and guidance about the investigation and prosecution of digital asset crimes. The Director of the NCET, Eun Young Choi, chaired the DAC Network\u2019s first meeting on September 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Reports on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets</strong></p>\n<p>The department\u2019s report on the Role of Law Enforcement in Detecting, Investigating, and Prosecuting Criminal Activity Related to Digital Assets begins by detailing the many ways in which illicit actors have exploited digital assets. It delineates three principal categories of illicit uses: 1) cryptocurrency as a means of payment for or manner of facilitating criminal activity; 2) the use of digital assets as a means of concealing illicit financial activity; and 3) crimes involving or undermining the digital asset ecosystem. The report also discusses how novel technology, particularly in the area of decentralized finance, or DeFi, has created new challenges for law enforcement; includes examples of successful law enforcement efforts to investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt digital asset crimes in spite of the investigative challenges; and describes initiatives that the department and other law enforcement agencies have established\u2014including the department\u2019s launch of the DAC Network\u2014to more effectively detect, investigate, prosecute, and otherwise disrupt crimes relating to digital assets, and to seize and forfeit those assets that constitute ill-gotten gains.</p>\n<p>The report also addresses the Executive Order\u2019s request for recommendations on appropriate regulatory and legislative actions. It proposes actions designed to enhance law enforcement\u2019s ability to gather evidence and initiate prosecutions; strengthen certain laws and penalty provisions that play an important role in digital asset prosecutions; support regulations that would enhance customer-identification efforts and other anti-money-laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; and ensure that law enforcement and regulatory agencies have adequate resources to conduct the technologically sophisticated investigations inherent in the digital assets space. The report identifies three proposals as priorities: 1) expanding to virtual asset service providers the laws preventing employees of financial institutions from tipping off suspects to ongoing investigations; 2) strengthening the law criminalizing the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses; and 3) extending the statute of limitations of certain statutes to account for the complexities of digital assets investigations.</p>\n<p>This report complements the June 2022 report issued by the department on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/1225896/dl?inline?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" target=\"_blank\">How to Strengthen International Law Enforcement Cooperation for Detecting, Investigating, and Prosecuting Criminal Activity Related to Digital Assets</a>, which details the unique challenges posed by cross-border digital asset investigations, and includes recommendations on how to bolster enforcement and improve international cooperation in the area.\u00a0 In line with the whole-of-government approach called for in the Executive Order, both reports are the culmination of collaborative efforts between the department, led by the NCET, and multiple federal agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Digital Asset Coordinators Network</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure that the department continues to meet the challenge posed by the illicit use of digital assets, the department\u2019s Criminal Division recently launched the nationwide DAC Network. Led by the NCET, in close coordination with the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, the DAC Network is composed of designated federal prosecutors from U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices nationwide and the department\u2019s litigating components. Each DAC will act as their office\u2019s subject-matter expert on digital assets, serving as a first-line source of information and guidance about legal and technical matters related to these technologies.</p>\n<p>As members of the DAC Network, prosecutors will learn about the application of existing authorities and laws to digital assets and best practices for investigating digital assets-related crimes, including for drafting search and seizure warrants, restraining orders, criminal and civil forfeiture actions, indictments, and other pleadings. The DAC Network will also serve as a source of information and discussion addressing new digital asset issues, such as DeFi, smart contracts, and token-based platforms, and their use in criminal activity. The DAC Network will likewise raise awareness of the unique international considerations of the crypto ecosystem, including the benefits of leveraging foreign relationships and the challenges of cross-border digital asset investigations.\u00a0</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[1]\u00a0In addition to the report, and in further response to the Executive Order, the Attorney General separately transmitted to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, via the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, an assessment from the Department of whether legislative changes would be necessary to issue a CBDC, should it be deemed appropriate and in the national interest.\u00a0</p></div>",

A five-day jury trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 4.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Dubnikov and his co-conspirators laundered the proceeds of ransomware attacks on individuals and organizations throughout the United States and abroad. Specifically, Dubnikov and his accomplices laundered ransom payments extracted from victims of Ryuk ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>After receiving ransom payments, Ryuk actors, Dubnikov and his co-conspirators, and others involved in the scheme, allegedly engaged in various financial transactions, including international financial transactions, to conceal the nature, source, location, ownership, and control of the ransom proceeds.</p>\n<p>In July 2019, Dubnikov allegedly laundered more than $400,000 in Ryuk ransom proceeds. Those involved in the conspiracy laundered at least $70 million in ransom proceeds.</p>\n<p>If convicted, Dubnikov faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>First identified in August 2018, Ryuk is a type of ransomware software that, when executed on a computer or network, encrypts files and attempts to delete any system backups. Of note, Ryuk can target storage drives contained within or physically connected to a computer, including those accessible remotely via a network connection. Ryuk has been used to target thousands of victims worldwide across a variety of sectors. In October 2020, law enforcement officials specifically identified Ryuk as an imminent and increasing cybercrime threat to hospitals and healthcare providers in the United States.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Portland Field Office is investigating the case.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs handled Dubnikov\u2019s extradition.</p>\n<p>Justice Department components who worked on this seizure coordinated their efforts through the department\u2019s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion attacks.</p>\n<p>The Task Force prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their crimes. The Task Force also strategically targets the ransomware criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.</p>\n<p><i>An indictment is merely an allegation.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey returned an indictment yesterday charging a resident of Florida with running a massive operation over many years to traffic in fraudulent and counterfeit Cisco networking equipment with an estimated retail value of over $1 billion.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Onur Aksoy, aka Ron Aksoy, aka Dave Durden, 38, of Miami, allegedly ran at least 19 companies formed in New Jersey and Florida as well as at least 15 Amazon storefronts, at least 10 eBay storefronts, and multiple other entities (collectively, the \u201cPro Network Entities\u201d) that imported tens of thousands of fraudulent and counterfeit Cisco networking devices from China and Hong Kong and resold them to customers in the United States and overseas, falsely representing the products as new and genuine. The operation allegedly generated over $100 million in revenue, and Aksoy received millions of dollars for his personal gain.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the devices the Pro Network Entities imported from China and Hong Kong were typically older, lower-model products, some of which had been sold or discarded, which Chinese counterfeiters then modified to appear to be genuine versions of new, enhanced, and more expensive Cisco devices. As alleged, the Chinese counterfeiters often added pirated Cisco software and unauthorized, low-quality, or unreliable components \u2013 including components to circumvent technological measures added by Cisco to the software to check for software license compliance and to authenticate the hardware. Finally, to make the devices appear new, genuine, high-quality, and factory-sealed by Cisco, the Chinese counterfeiters allegedly added counterfeited Cisco labels, stickers, boxes, documentation, packaging, and other materials.</p>\n<p>The fraudulent and counterfeit products sold by the Pro Network Entities suffered from numerous performance, functionality, and safety problems. Often, they would simply fail or otherwise malfunction, causing significant damage to their users\u2019 networks and operations \u2013 in some cases, costing users tens of thousands of dollars. Customers of Aksoy\u2019s fraudulent and counterfeit devices included hospitals, schools, government agencies, and the military.</p>\n<p>As set forth in the indictment, between 2014 and 2022, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized approximately 180 shipments of counterfeit Cisco devices being shipped to the Pro Network Entities from China and Hong Kong. In response to some of these seizures, Aksoy allegedly falsely submitted official paperwork to CBP under the alias \u201cDave Durden,\u201d an identity that he used to communicate with Chinese co-conspirators. To try to avoid CBP scrutiny, Chinese co-conspirators allegedly broke the shipments up into smaller parcels and shipped them on different days, and Aksoy used at least two fake delivery addresses in Ohio. After CBP seized a shipment of counterfeit Cisco products to Aksoy and the Pro Network Entities and sent a seizure notice, Aksoy allegedly often continued to order counterfeit Cisco products from the same supplier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, between 2014 and 2019, Cisco sent seven letters to Aksoy asking him to cease and desist his trafficking of counterfeit goods. Aksoy allegedly responded to at least two of these letters by causing his attorney to provide Cisco with forged documents. In July 2021, agents executed a search warrant at Aksoy\u2019s warehouse and seized 1,156 counterfeit Cisco devices with a retail value of over $7 million.</p>\n<p>Aksoy is charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to commit mail and wire fraud; three counts of mail fraud; four counts of wire fraud; and three counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods. Aksoy was charged by a criminal complaint filed in New Jersey on June 29 and was arrested in Miami the same day.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Today, the Western District of Oklahoma unsealed an indictment charging three individuals with violating federal wire fraud and money laundering statutes in connection with an operation to sell over $88 million of stolen Avaya Direct International (ADI) software licenses, which were used to unlock features of a popular telephone system used by thousands of companies around the globe.</p>\n<p>The grand jury charged the following defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 13 counts of wire fraud:\u00a0 Raymond Bradley Pearce, aka Brad Pearce, 46, of Tuttle, Oklahoma; Dusti O. Pearce, 44, of Tuttle, Oklahoma; and Jason M. Hines, aka Joe Brown, aka Chad Johnson, aka Justin Albaum, 42, of Caldwell, New Jersey. In addition, the grand jury charged both Brad Pearce and Dusti Pearce with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Avaya Holdings Corporation, a multinational business communications company headquartered in California, sold a product called IP Office, a telephone system used by many midsize and small businesses in the United States and abroad. To enable additional functionality of IP Office such as voicemail or more telephones, customers had to purchase software licenses \u2013 which Avaya generated \u2013 from an authorized Avaya distributor or reseller. Avaya used software license keys to control access to Avaya\u2019s copyright-protected software and to ensure that only customers who paid for the software could use it. In addition, Avaya required that each software license on an IP Office system be associated with the system\u2019s Avaya Secure Digital (SD) card \u2013 a small flash memory card with a unique serial number that plugged into the IP Office manager computer \u2013 which the end user had to keep in its possession in order to use the licenses.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Brad Pearce, a long-time customer service employee at Avaya, allegedly used his system administrator privileges to generate tens of millions of dollars of ADI software license keys that he sold to Hines and other customers, who in turn sold them to resellers and end users around the globe. The retail value of each Avaya software license ranged from under $100 to thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>As set forth in the indictment, Brad Pearce also allegedly employed his system administrator privileges to hijack the accounts of former Avaya employees to generate additional ADI software license keys. Furthermore, he allegedly used these privileges to alter information about the accounts to conceal the fact that he was generating ADI license keys, preventing Avaya from discovering the fraud scheme for many years. Brad Pearce\u2019s wife, Dusti Pearce, is alleged to have handled accounting and helped run the financial side of the illegal business. Hines operated Direct Business Services International (DBSI), a de-authorized Avaya reseller, in New Jersey. He allegedly bought software licenses from the Pearces under his own name and also using an alias, Joe Brown. Hines was the Pearces\u2019 largest customer and significantly influenced how the scheme operated. Hines also received help from Brad Pearce to resell the stolen software licenses. Hines was allegedly one of the biggest users of the ADI license system in the world.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the Pearces and Hines\u2019 operation not only prevented Avaya from making any money on its stolen intellectual property but also undercut the global market in Avaya ADI software licenses because the Pearces and Hines were selling licenses for significantly below the wholesale price. In fact, Brad Pearce allegedly told Hines that the Pearces\u2019 customers could not obtain same-day ADI software licenses from anyone else for anything even close to the Pearces\u2019 prices, and Hines suggested that he and Brad Pearce work together to \u201ccorner\u201d the market in licenses. Altogether, the Pearces and Hines allegedly reaped millions of dollars from the fraud. Moreover, to hide the nature and source of the money, the Pearces allegedly funneled their illegal gains through a PayPal account created under a false name to multiple bank accounts, and then transferred the money to numerous other investment and bank accounts. They also allegedly purchased large quantities of gold bullion and other valuable items. The indictment lists numerous assets subject to forfeiture including cash, gold, silver, collectible coins, cryptocurrency, and real property.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester for the Western District of Oklahoma, and Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Gray of the FBI\u2019s Oklahoma City Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>The FBI conducted the investigation.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel Matthew A. Lamberti of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Julia E.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A man charged with conducting ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including the July 2021 attack against Kaseya, made his initial appearance and was arraigned today in the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p>According to an August 2021 indictment, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, accessed the internal computer networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to encrypt the data on the computers of victim companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen last year I announced charges against members of the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware group, I made clear that the Justice Department will spare no resource in identifying and bringing to justice transnational cybercriminals who target the American people,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThat is exactly what we have done. The United States, alongside our international partners, will continue to swiftly identify, locate, and apprehend alleged cybercriminals, capture their illicit profits, and bring them to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust eight months after committing his alleged ransomware attack on Kaseya from overseas, this defendant has arrived in a Dallas courtroom to face justice,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cWhen we are attacked, we will work with our partners here and abroad to go after cybercriminals, wherever they may be.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2, 2021, ransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused the deployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused the Kaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to \u201cendpoints\u201d on Kaseya customer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the ransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on computers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.</p>\n<p>Through the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendant allegedly left electronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims\u2019 computers. The notes included a web address leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a publicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting either website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address to use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom, the defendant provided the decryption key and the victim then was able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the ransom, the defendant typically posted the victim\u2019s stolen data or claimed they sold the stolen data to third parties, and victims remained unable to access their files.</p>\n<p>Vasinskyi is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted of all counts, he faces a total penalty of 115 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national with ties to a ransomware group linked to Russia-based actors, was taken into custody in Poland where he remained held by authorities pending proceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States, pursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. Vasinskyi was transported to Dallas by U.S. law enforcement authorities where he arrived on March 3. He made his initial court appearance and was arraigned today in the Northern District of Texas.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers for the Northern District of Texas and Senior Counsel Byron M.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Chief Financial Officer of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Wanzhou Meng, 49, of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), appeared today in federal district court in Brooklyn, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn entering into the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Nicole Boeckmann for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cHer admissions in the statement of facts confirm that, while acting as the Chief Financial Officer for Huawei, Meng made multiple material misrepresentations to a senior executive of a financial institution regarding Huawei\u2019s business operations in Iran in an effort to preserve Huawei\u2019s banking relationship with the financial institution. The truth about Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, which Meng concealed, would have been important to the financial institution\u2019s decision to continue its banking relationship with Huawei. Meng\u2019s admissions confirm the crux of the government\u2019s allegations in the prosecution of this financial fraud \u2014 that Meng and her fellow Huawei employees engaged in a concerted effort to deceive global financial institutions, the U.S. government and the public about Huawei\u2019s activities in Iran.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Deferred Prosecution Agreement will lead to the end of the ongoing extradition proceedings in Canada, which otherwise could have continued for many months, if not years,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWe are enormously grateful to Canada\u2019s Department of Justice for its dedicated work on this extradition and for its steadfast adherence to the rule of law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinancial institutions are our first line of defense in maintaining the safety and security of the U.S. financial system,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThat is why the law requires that companies who avail themselves of the U.S. financial system provide financial institutions with truthful information about their business operations. Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei Technologies, admitted today that she failed to tell the truth about Huawei\u2019s operations in Iran, and as a result the financial institution\u00a0continued to do business with Huawei in violation of U.S. law. Our prosecution team continues to prepare for trial against Huawei, and we look forward to proving our case against the company in court.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMeng's admissions are evidence of a consistent pattern of deception to violate U.S. law,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe FBI will continue to aggressively investigate companies doing business in the United States when there are signs they behave with contempt for our laws.\u201d</p>\n<p><u>The Scheme to Defraud Financial Institutions</u></p>\n<p>According to court documents, and as agreed to by Meng in the DPA\u2019s statement of facts, Skycom Tech. Co. Ltd. (Skycom) was a Hong Kong company that primarily operated in Iran. As of February 2007, Skycom was wholly owned by a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei), Hua Ying Management (Hua Ying). In November 2007, Hua Ying transferred its shares of Skycom to another entity that Huawei controlled, Canicula Holdings (Canicula). At the time Hua Ying transferred its Skycom shares to Canicula, Meng was the Secretary of Hua Ying.</p>\n<p>In February 2008, after Huawei transferred ownership of Skycom from Hua Ying to Canicula, Meng joined Skycom\u2019s Board of Directors, which was comprised of Huawei employees. She served on the Board until April 2009. After Meng departed from Skycom\u2019s Board, Skycom\u2019s Board members continued to be Huawei employees, Canicula continued to own Skycom, and Canicula continued to be controlled by Huawei. As of August 2012, Huawei included Skycom among a list of \u201cother Huawei subsidiaries\u201d in Huawei corporate documents written in English.</p>\n<p>Between 2010 and 2014, Huawei controlled Skycom\u2019s business operations in Iran, and Skycom was owned by an entity controlled by Huawei. All significant Skycom business decisions were made by Huawei. Moreover, Skycom\u2019s countrymanager \u2013 the head of the business \u2013 was a Huawei employee. Individuals employed by Skycom believed they worked for Huawei.</p>\n<p>During the same time period, Huawei employees engaged with a U.K. staffing company to provide engineers in Iran to support Skycom\u2019s work with Iranian telecommunications service providers. Negotiations and contracting on behalf of Skycom were conducted by Huawei employees. To pay for these contractors, Huawei sent at least $7.5 million to the U.K. staffing company in a series of approximately 80 payments from Skycom\u2019s bank accounts in Asia, including at a multinational financial institution (Financial Institution 1), to the U.K. staffing company\u2019s account in the United Kingdom. The transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars and cleared through the United States.</p>\n<p>In December 2012 and January 2013, various news organizations, including Reuters, reported that Skycom offered to sell \u201cembargoed\u201d equipment from a U.S. computer equipment manufacturer in Iran in potential violation of U.S. export controls law, and that Huawei had close ties with Skycom. In a statement to Reuters published in a December 2012 article, Huawei claimed that Skycom was one of its \u201cmajor local partners\u201d in Iran. Reuters reported that Huawei had further stated that \u201cHuawei\u2019s business in Iran is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the U.N., U.S. and E.U. This commitment has been carried out and followed strictly by our company. Further, we also require our partners to follow the same commitment and strictly abide by the relevant laws and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p>In January 2013, a subsequent Reuters article reported that Meng served on the Board of Directors of Skycom between February 2008 and April 2009 and identified other connections between Skycom directors and Huawei. The article also quoted the following statement from Huawei: \u201cThe relationship between Huawei and Skycom is a normal business partnership. Huawei has established a trade compliance system which is in line with industry best practices and our business in Iran is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the UN. We also require our partners, such as Skycom, to make the same commitments.\u201d This statement was incorrect, as Huawei operated and controlled Skycom; Skycom was therefore not Huawei\u2019s business \u201cpartner.\u201d</p>\n<p>After these articles were published, Financial Institution 1 and other global financial institutions that provided international banking services to Huawei (collectively, the \u201cFinancial Institutions\u201d), including U.S. dollar-clearing, made inquiries to Huawei in response to the above-described press reports. In early 2013, Huawei employees represented to the Financial Institutions that Skycom was just a local business partner of Huawei in Iran and that Skycom had not conducted Iran-related transactions using its accounts at the Financial Institutions.</p>\n<p>To address the allegations in the news reports, Huawei requested an in-person meeting with a senior Financial Institution 1 employee. That meeting occurred on Aug. 22, 2013 in Hong Kong, at which time Meng met with an executive of Financial Institution 1 responsible for operations in the Asia Pacific region. During the meeting, Meng delivered a PowerPoint presentation written in Chinese, which was translated by an interpreter into English. Meng stated that she was using an interpreter to be precise in her language.</p>\n<p>In her presentation, Meng stated, among other things, that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation\u201d and \u201cnormal and controllable business cooperation,\u201d and she described Skycom as a \u201cpartner,\u201d a \u201cbusiness partner of Huawei,\u201d and a \u201cthird party Huawei works with\u201d in Iran. Those statements were untrue because, as Meng knew, Skycom was not a business partner of, or a third party working with, Huawei; instead, Huawei controlled Skycom, and Skycom employees were really Huawei employees. It would have been material to Financial Institution 1 to know that Huawei controlled Skycom.</p>\n<p>In addition, Meng stated that Huawei \u201cwas once a shareholder of Skycom\u201d but had \u201csold all its shares in Skycom.\u201d Those statements were untrue, because, as Meng knew, Huawei had \u201csold\u201d its shares to an entity that Huawei controlled. Specifically, Huawei transferred Skycom shares from a Huawei subsidiary (Hua Ying) to another entity that was controlled by Huawei (Canicula). It would have been material to Financial Institution 1 to know that Skycom was transferred from one Huawei-controlled entity to another.</p>\n<p>Finally, Meng stated that Huawei \u201coperates in Iran in strict compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions\u201d and that \u201cthere has been no violation of export control regulations\u201d by \u201cHuawei or any third party Huawei works with.\u201d These statements were untrue because Huawei\u2019s operation of Skycom, which caused the Financial Institutions to provide prohibited services, including banking services, for Huawei\u2019s Iran-based business while Huawei concealed Skycom\u2019s link to Huawei, was in violation of the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560. Moreover, between 2010 and 2014, Huawei caused Skycom to conduct approximately $100 million worth of U.S.-dollar transactions through Financial Institution 1 that cleared through the United States, at least some of which supported its work in Iran in violation of U.S. law, including $7.5 million for Iran-based contractors from the U.K. staffing company to do work in Iran.</p>\n<p>At no point during or after the meeting did Meng, who was aware of Huawei\u2019s public statements about Skycom in Reuters, retract or amend any of those statements. Moreover, Huawei\u2019s Treasurer, who also attended the August meeting, did not correct or amend any of the statements made by Meng.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the meeting between Meng and Financial Institution 1, Huawei prepared an English version of the PowerPoint presentation at Financial Institution 1\u2019s request. Meng later arranged for a paper copy of that PowerPoint presentation to be delivered to the Financial Institution 1 executive she had met with in September 2013. The representations in the English version of the PowerPoint presentation closely tracked the ones Meng had made during the meeting.</p>\n<p>After the meeting and subsequent to receipt of Meng\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, Financial Institution 1 decided to continue its relationship with Huawei. The other Financial Institutions similarly continued their respective relationships with Huawei.</p>\n<p><u>The DPA</u></p>\n<p>Under the terms of the DPA, Meng has agreed to the accuracy of a four-page statement of facts that details the knowingly false statements she made to Financial Institution 1. Meng also has agreed not to commit other federal, state or local crimes. If Meng breaches the agreement, she will be subject to prosecution of all the charges against her in the third superseding indictment filed in this case. The government also agreed to withdraw its request to the Ministry of Justice of Canada that Meng be extradited to the United States.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>An indictment was unsealed yesterday in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charging a New Jersey man, a California man, and a New York man with federal crimes arising out of a wide-ranging and lucrative copyright infringement scheme.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Bill Omar Carrasquillo, 35, of Swedesboro, New Jersey; Jesse Gonzales, 42, of Pico Rivera, California; and Michael Barone, 36, of Richmond Hill, New York, operated a large-scale cable theft scheme between at least March 2016 and at least November 2019, in which they fraudulently obtained cable television accounts and then resold copyrighted content to thousands of their own subscribers. According to the indictment, the defendants also made fraudulent misrepresentations to banks and merchant processors in an effort to obtain merchant processing accounts. The defendants allegedly earned more than $30 million from the scheme.</p>\n<p>As alleged, Carrasquillo converted a large portion of his profits into homes and dozens of vehicles, including high-end sports cars. When agents attempted to seize those items pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, Carrasquillo made false statements about and attempted to hide some of those vehicles, including a Freightliner recreational vehicle and a McLaren sports vehicle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe take seriously schemes for profit that infringe upon copyrights,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cThe charges announced today demonstrate the department\u2019s continuing commitment to protect copyright holders from theft.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants are charged with engaging in a massive, years-long scheme to steal copyrighted content, which is a serious federal crime,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \u201cAs this prosecution shows, protecting intellectual property rights is an important priority of our office and the entire Department of Justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just go and monetize someone else\u2019s copyrighted content with impunity,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley S. Benavides of the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia Division. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of securing a copyright. Theft is theft, and if you\u2019re going to willfully steal another party\u2019s intellectual property, the FBI stands ready to step in and shut you down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll income is taxable, including income derived from illegal means,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Yury Kruty of the Philadelphia Field Office for IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). \u201cIn addition, it is a crime to knowingly engage in monetary transactions involving criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000 that is derived from a specified unlawful activity, such as wire fraud. IRS-CI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring charges against individuals who choose to participate in illegal schemes such as that alleged here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo was arrested on Sept. 21. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and related offenses; one count of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; one count of reproduction of a protected work; 19 counts of public performance of a protected work; four counts of access device fraud; six counts of wire fraud; three counts of making false statements to a bank; 19 counts of money laundering; two counts of making false statements to law enforcement officers; two counts of removal of property to prevent seizure; and four counts of tax evasion. In total, if convicted of all counts, Carrasquillo faces up to 514 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez was arrested on Sept. 21. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and related offenses; one count of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; one count of reproduction of a protected work; 19 counts of public performance of a protected work; four counts of access device fraud; five counts of wire fraud; two counts of making false statements to a bank; and one count of money laundering. In total, if convicted of all counts, Gonzales faces up to 244 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A summons to appear in court was issued to Barone, and he is scheduled to make his initial appearance today in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and related offenses; one count of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; two counts of access device fraud; and five counts of wire fraud. In total, if convicted of all counts, Barone faces up to 130 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>The FBI and IRS-CI are investigating the case.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Jeff Pearlman of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher J.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Muhammad Fahd, a citizen of Pakistan and Grenada, was sentenced today to 12 years in prison for his leadership role in a seven-year scheme to unlawfully unlock nearly 2 million phones to defraud AT&amp;T Inc. (AT&amp;T), inflicting more than $200 million in losses. At the sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik for the Western District of Washington noted that Fahd had committed a \u201cterrible cybercrime over an extended period,\u201d even after he was aware that law enforcement was investigating.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2012, Fahd, 35, conspired with others to recruit AT&amp;T employees at a call center located in Bothell, Washington, to unlock large numbers of cellular phones for profit. Fahd recruited and bribed AT&amp;T employees to use their AT&amp;T credentials to unlock phones for ineligible customers. Later in the conspiracy, Fahd had the bribed employees install custom malware and hacking tools that allowed him to unlock phones remotely from Pakistan.\u00a0In September 2020, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>\n<p>Cellular phones such as iPhones cost hundreds of dollars. To make the phones more affordable, during the relevant time, AT&amp;T subsidized the purchase cost of phones or sold phones to customers under installment plans. Unlocking a phone effectively removes it from AT&amp;T\u2019s network, thereby allowing the account holder to avoid having to pay AT&amp;T for service or to make any payments for purchase of the phone.</p>\n<p>According to records filed in the case, in approximately June or July of 2012, using the alias \u201cFrank Zhang,\u201d Fahd contacted an AT&amp;T employee through Facebook. Fahd offered the employee significant sums of money if the employee would help Fahd secretly unlock phones at AT&amp;T. Fahd also asked the employee to recruit other AT&amp;T employees to help with the unauthorized unlocks.</p>\n<p>Fahd instructed the recruited employees to set up fake businesses and bank accounts for those businesses, to receive payments and to create fictitious invoices for every deposit made into the fake businesses\u2019 bank accounts to create the appearance that the money was payment for genuine services.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2013, AT&amp;T implemented a new unlocking system that made it more difficult for the bribed employees to unlock IMEIs for Fahd. In response, Fahd hired a software developer to design malware that could be installed without authorization on AT&amp;T\u2019s computer system to unlock phones more efficiently and in larger numbers. At Fahd\u2019s request, the employees provided confidential information to Fahd about AT&amp;T\u2019s computer system and unlocking procedures to assist in this process. Fahd also had the employees install malware on AT&amp;T\u2019s computers that captured information about AT&amp;T\u2019s computer system and the network access credentials of other AT&amp;T employees. Fahd provided the information to his malware developer, so the developer could tailor the malware to work on AT&amp;T\u2019s computers.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T\u2019s forensic analysis shows the total number of cellular telephones fraudulently unlocked by members of the scheme was 1,900,033 phones. AT&amp;T has further determined that the loss it suffered because customers, whose cellular phones were illegally unlocked, failed to complete payments for their cellular telephones was $201,497,430.94.</p>\n<p>Judge Lasnik ordered restitution of $200,620,698. (The difference between this amount and the total loss reflects restitution ordered against bribed AT&amp;T employees in related prosecutions.)</p>\n<p>Fahd was indicted in 2017 and arrested in Hong Kong in 2018. He was extradited and appeared in U.S. District Court in Seattle in August 2019. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2020.</p>\n<p>This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle field office of the U.S. Secret Service, IRS-CI and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance.</p>\n<p>This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew Friedman and Francis Franze-Nakamura of the Western District of Washington and Senior Counsel Anthony Teelucksingh of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.</p></div>",

Using an illegal practice known as \u201cSIM-swapping,\u201d Meiggs and others conspired to hack into and take control of these victims\u2019 online accounts to obtain things of value, including OG social media account names and cryptocurrency.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, SIM-swapping attacks involve convincing a victim\u2019s cellphone carrier to reassign the victim\u2019s phone number from the SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module card) inside the victim\u2019s cellphone to the SIM card inside a cellphone controlled by the cybercriminals.\u00a0Cybercriminals then pose as the victim with an online account provider and request that the provider send account password-reset links or an authentication code to the SIM-swapped device now controlled by them. The cybercriminals can then reset the victim\u2019s account log-in credentials and use those credentials to access the victim\u2019s account without authorization, or \u201chack into\u201d the account.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Meiggs and his coconspirators targeted at least 10 identified victims around the country. Members of the conspiracy stole, or attempted to steal, more than $530,000 in cryptocurrency from these victims. Meiggs also took control of two victims\u2019 \u201cOG\u201d accounts with social media companies.</p>\n<p>Meiggs pleaded guilty to each of seven counts in an indictment, charging him with conspiracy, wire fraud, computer fraud and abuse, and aggravated identity theft. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 15, and faces a mandatory minimum penalty of two years in prison, to be served consecutively to any other sentence.

You was originally indicted in February 2019 for trade secret offenses and wire fraud, and was charged in a superseding indictment with\u00a0 economic espionage and conspiracy to commit economic espionage in August 2020.</p>\n<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, You\u00a0stole valuable trade secrets related to formulations for bisphenol-A-free (BPA-free) coatings for the inside of beverage cans. You was granted access to the trade secrets while working at The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia, and Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tennessee. The stolen trade secrets belonged to major chemical and coating companies including Akzo-Nobel, BASF, Dow Chemical, PPG, Toyochem, Sherwin Williams, and Eastman Chemical Company, and cost nearly $120,000,000 to develop.</p>\n<p>According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, You stole the trade secrets to set up a new BPA-free coating company in China. You and her Chinese corporate partner, Weihai Jinhong Group, received millions of dollars in Chinese government grants to support the new company (including a Thousand Talents Plan award). Documents related to You\u2019s Thousand Talents Program application were admitted at trial; those documents, and other evidence presented at trial, showed the defendant\u2019s intent to benefit not only Weihai Jinhong Group, but also the governments of China, the Chinese province of Shandong, and the Chinese city of Weihai, as well as her intent to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n<p>Until recently, BPA was used to coat the inside of cans and other food and beverage containers to help minimize flavor loss and prevent the container from corroding or reacting with the food or beverage contained therein. However, due to BPA\u2019s potential health risks, companies began searching for BPA-free alternatives. As witnesses from the chemical and coating companies testified at trial, developing these BPA-free alternatives was a very expensive and time-consuming process.</p>\n<p>From December 2012 through Aug. 31, 2017, You was employed as Principal Engineer for Global Research at Coca-Cola, which had agreements with numerous companies to conduct research and development, testing, analysis and review of various BPA-free technologies. Because of You\u2019s extensive education and experience with BPA and BPA-free coating technologies, she was one of a limited number of Coca-Cola employees with access to BPA-free trade secrets belonging to Akzo-Nobel, BASF, Dow Chemical, PPG, Toyochem, and Sherwin Williams. From approximately September 2017 through June 2018, You was employed as a packaging application development manager for Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tennessee, where she was one of a limited number of employees with access to trade secrets belonging to Eastman.</p>\n<p>You is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 1 at 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the National Security Division; Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; and Acting U.S. Attorney Francis M.

According to the indictment, Gaines conspired with others to rig bids at online public auctions of surplus government equipment conducted by the GSA from about July 2012 until as late as May 2018. Gaines is the third individual charged and the third individual to plead guilty in the investigation.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, the defendant\u2019s self-serving scheme stole from the government and robbed American taxpayers,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Richard A. Powers of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division. \u201cI commend the team of GSA Office of Inspector General (OIG) agents and Antitrust Division prosecutors and paralegals for their dedication to safeguarding online auctions from collusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompetition is a fundamental component of any fair auction,\u201d said Inspector General Carol F. Ochoa of the GSA. \u201cGSA OIG will continue to investigate allegations of collusive activities that undermine the integrity of GSA Auctions and short-change the taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The GSA operates GSA Auctions, which offers the general public the opportunity to bid electronically on a wide variety of federal assets, including computer equipment that is no longer needed by government agencies. GSA Auctions sells that equipment via its online auctions, and the proceeds of the auctions are distributed to the government agencies or the U.S. Treasury general fund.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the primary purpose of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition. The indictment further alleges that Gaines and his co-conspirators obtained the equipment by agreeing which co-conspirators would submit bids for particular lots offered for sale by GSA Auctions and which co-conspirator would be designated to win a particular lot.</p>\n<p>Gaines pleaded guilty to a violation of the Sherman Act. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $1 million criminal fine for individuals. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>A California man was charged in a complaint unsealed today for his alleged participation in a coordinated cryptocurrency and securities fraud scheme that used purported digital currency platforms and foreign-based financial accounts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>John DeMarr, 55, of Santa Ana, was charged in a complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. DeMarr made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge John D. Early of the Central District of California. Judge Early referred the case to the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment alleges an elaborate scheme in which the defendant conspired to lure unsuspecting investors with fraudulent promises of large returns in the cryptocurrency market, only to divert millions of dollars for his own personal use,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWhile the technologies and methods are constantly changing, the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to aggressively pursuing fraud in all its forms remains unchanged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, DeMarr made misrepresentations and false promises that coaxed investors into pouring millions of dollars into fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes, all to facilitate his extravagant lifestyle,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. \u201cWe will continue to root out and prosecute those who would cheat investors to line their own pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. DeMarr created an elaborate cryptocurrency scheme, complete with high profile endorsements and incredibly large returns that proved to be a mirage costing investors millions,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge Kristi K. Johnson of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cMr. DeMarr is now in custody and no longer spending his victims' money, nor hiding from justice by faking his own disappearance.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn today\u2019s hi-tech financial world there are increasingly more opportunities for fraudsters to take advantage of people and their bank accounts,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cJohn DeMarr\u2019s Bitcoin operation is one such example of a cryptocurrency investment scheme that did not payoff for his investors. Claiming to be part of a cryptocurrency \u2018ecosystem,\u2019 DeMarr created nothing more than an elaborate fraud scheme where he stole his investors\u2019 money to fund his own personal lifestyle, resulting in losses totaling over $11 million. Financial crimes never pay, as one way or another the person behind the computer will be caught and will be held accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint, between 2017 and 2018, DeMarr conspired with others to defraud\u00a0 numerous victims of $11.4 million by inducing them to invest in their companies, \u201cStart Options\u201d and \u201cB2G,\u201d based on materially false and misleading representations. Start Options purported to be an online investment platform that provided cryptocurrency mining, trading, and digital asset trading services. B2G was purportedly an \u201cecosystem\u201d that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, provide digital wallet staking, and trade digital and fiat currencies \u201con a secure, comprehensive platform.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations, however, both Start Options and B2G were fraudulent. In approximately December 2017, DeMarr and others began offering securities in the form of investment contracts to U.S. and international investors through the Start Options website. Investments were accepted in Bitcoin, U.S. dollars, or Euros. To participate, investors had to deposit their funds for a specified contract period, after which they could purportedly withdraw their money at a significant profit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among other things, DeMarr and others falsely claimed that investor funds would be invested in digital asset mining and trading platforms that would earn them massive profits. In truth, however, the money was never invested and was instead diverted to accounts controlled by DeMarr and others and used for various personal expenditures, including the purchase of a Porsche, jewelry, and renovations to DeMarr\u2019s home in California.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Similarly, according to the complaint, Start Options also purported to feature celebrity endorsements to promote its securities offerings. For example, a professional athlete purportedly endorsed Start Options when, as alleged in the indictment, the athlete had no involvement with Start Options and his name and likeness were used without his consent. Based on this and other fraudulent promotional materials, investors sent millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and fiat currency to financial accounts, including cryptowallets, controlled by DeMarr and others in the U.S. and abroad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As alleged, in or about late January 2018, rather than permitting Start Options investors to withdraw money from their accounts after the requisite time period, DeMarr and others required investors to roll over their accounts into an unregistered \u201cinitial coin offering,\u201d or ICO, of B2G, the second of the two fraudulent companies in which DeMarr was involved. Among other fraudulent misrepresentations, DeMarr and others falsely told investors that the ICO would raise capital for the company to build an \u201cecosystem\u201d that would allow users to trade B2G tokens, provide digital wallet staking, and trading. In truth, investors never actually received any digital tokens and funds from the offering were not used to develop the B2G platform.</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, DeMarr and others also paid various promoters, including an actor famous for martial arts films made in the 1980s and 1990s, to serve as a promoter and celebrity spokesperson, falsely claiming that B2G could generate an \u201c8000%\u201d return for investors within one year, and that he was a participant in the ICO. DeMarr and others also created false press releases and whitepapers about B2G, fabricated B2G account statements, and refused to allow investors to withdraw their money.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As alleged in the complaint, DeMarr staged his own disappearance to avoid facing disgruntled B2G investors. DeMarr instructed others to release statements asserting that DeMarr had been assaulted and went missing in Montenegro, and telling B2G investors to stop attempting to contact DeMarr or his family regarding their inability to have the money they invested in B2G returned.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Department of Justice today announced a coordinated international law enforcement action to disrupt a sophisticated form of ransomware known as NetWalker.</p>\n<p>NetWalker ransomware has impacted numerous victims, including companies, municipalities, hospitals, law enforcement, emergency services, school districts, colleges, and universities. Attacks have specifically targeted the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking advantage of the global crisis to extort victims.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are striking back against the growing threat of ransomware by not only bringing criminal charges against the responsible actors, but also disrupting criminal online infrastructure and, wherever possible, recovering ransom payments extorted from victims,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cRansomware victims should know that coming forward to law enforcement as soon as possible after an attack can lead to significant results like those achieved in today\u2019s multi-faceted operation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The NetWalker action includes charges against a Canadian national in relation to NetWalker ransomware attacks in which tens of millions of dollars were allegedly obtained, the seizure of approximately $454,530.19 in cryptocurrency from ransom payments, and the disablement of a dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker ransomware victims.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis action reflects the resolve of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida to target and disrupt sophisticated, international cybercrime schemes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez for the Middle District of Florida.\u00a0 \u201cWhile these individuals believe they operate anonymously in the digital space, we have the skill and tenacity to identify and prosecute these actors to the full extent of the law and seize their criminal proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, NetWalker operates as a so-called ransomware-as-a-service model, featuring \u201cdevelopers\u201d and \u201caffiliates.\u201d Developers are responsible for creating and updating the ransomware and making it available to affiliates. Affiliates are responsible for identifying and attacking high-value victims with the ransomware, according to the affidavit. After a victim pays, developers and affiliates split the ransom.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case illustrates the FBI\u2019s capabilities and global partnerships in tracking ransomware attackers, unmasking them, and holding them accountable for their alleged criminal actions,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Michael F. McPherson of the FBI\u2019s Tampa Field Office. \u201cIf you are a victim of ransomware, contact your local FBI field office or submit a tip to tips.fbi.gov. You can also file a complaint with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at <a href=\"http://www.ic3.gov\">www.ic3.gov</a>.\u201d</p>\n<div>\n<div> <img alt=\"Seizure page of dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker ransomware victims\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/styles/d06/public/press-releases/images/2021/01/27/splash_page_0.jpg?itok=9SjbFqaX\" title=\"Seizure page of dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker ransomware victims\" width=\"600\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nSeizure page of dark web hidden resource used to communicate with NetWalker ransomware victims.\n\n\n\n<p>According to the affidavit, once a victim\u2019s computer network is compromised and data is encrypted, actors that deploy NetWalker deliver a file, or ransom note, to the victim. Using Tor, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the internet, the victim is then provided with the amount of ransom demanded and instructions for payment.</p>\n<p>Actors that deploy NetWalker commonly gain unauthorized access to a victim\u2019s computer network days or weeks prior to the delivery of the ransom note. During this time, they surreptitiously elevate their privileges within the network while spreading the ransomware from workstation to workstation. They then send the ransom note only once they are satisfied that they have sufficiently infiltrated the victim\u2019s network to extort payment, according to the affidavit.</p>\n<p>According to an indictment unsealed today, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins of Gatineau, a Canadian national, was charged in the Middle District of Florida. Vachon-Desjardins is alleged to have obtained at least over $27.6 million as a result of the offenses charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department further announced that on Jan. 10, law enforcement seized approximately $454,530.19 in cryptocurrency, which was comprised of ransom payments made by victims of three separate NetWalker ransomware attacks.</p>\n<p>This week, authorities in Bulgaria also seized a dark web hidden resource used by NetWalker ransomware affiliates to provide payment instructions and communicate with victims. Visitors to the resource will now find a seizure banner that notifies them that it has been seized by law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>The investigation was led by the FBI\u2019s Tampa field office.</p>\n<p>Trial Attorneys S. Riane Harper and Brian Mund of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carlton C. Gammons and Suzanne Nebesky of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case against Vachon-Desjardins.</p>\n<p>Substantial assistance was provided by the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs. Additionally, the Bulgarian National Investigation Service and General Directorate Combating Organized Crime provided substantial assistance in the seizure of the dark web hidden resource.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p></div>",

Zuckerman of the Tax Division, U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California, and Chief of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Jim Lee. The charges stem from an alleged decades-long scheme to conceal approximately $2 billion in income from the IRS as well as a scheme to defraud investors in the software company\u2019s debt securities.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment reflects the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to finding and prosecuting the costliest and most sophisticated tax crimes in the United States,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division Richard E. Zuckerman.</p>\n<p>\u201cComplexity will not hide crime from law enforcement,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Anderson. \u201cSophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges. We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Mr. Brockman is responsible for carrying out an approximately two billion dollar tax evasion scheme,\u201d said Jim Lee, Chief of IRS Criminal Investigation. \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation aggressively pursues tax cheats domestically and abroad. No scheme is too complex or sophisticated for our investigators. Those hiding income or assets offshore are encouraged to come forward and voluntarily disclose their holdings.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Brockman, a resident of Houston, Texas, and Pitkin County, Colorado, used a web of offshore entities based in Bermuda and Nevis to hide from the IRS income earned on his investments in private equity funds which were managed by a San Francisco-based investment firm. As part of the alleged scheme, Brockman directed untaxed capital gains income to secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. The indictment further alleges that to execute the fraud, between 1999 and 2019, Brockman took measures such as backdating records and using encrypted communications and code words to communicate with a co-conspirator, among other alleged actions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the tax offenses, the indictment alleges that, between 2008 and 2010, Brockman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $67.8 million in the software company\u2019s debt securities. As CEO, Brockman was contractually restricted from purchasing any of the software company\u2019s debt securities without prior notice, full disclosure, and amending the associated credit agreements. The indictment alleges that Brockman used a third-party to circumvent those requirements, to acquire the debt securities, and to conceal from the sellers valuable economic information. The indictment further alleges that Brockman used material, non-public information about the software company to make decisions about purchasing the debt. In addition, Brockman allegedly persuaded another individual to alter, destroy, and mutilate documents and computer evidence with the intent to impair the use of such evidence in a grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p>Brockman is charged with conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; seven counts of tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201; six counts of failing to file foreign bank account reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5314 &amp; 5322(b); 20 counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; two counts of concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)), and tax evasion money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(ii)); and one count each of international concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)); evidence tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(2)(B), and destruction of evidence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(1).</p>\n<p>An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed.

Guan later admitted that he had participated in military training and wore military uniforms while at NUDT. \u00a0One of Guan\u2019s NUDT faculty advisors in China was also a lieutenant general in the PLA who developed computers used by the PLA General Staff Department, the PLA General Armament Department, Air Force, military weather forecasts, and nuclear technology. \u00a0NUDT is \u201csuspected of procuring U.S.-origin items to develop supercomputers with nuclear explosive applications\u201d and has been placed on the Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List for nuclear nonproliferation reasons, according to the affidavit.</p>\n<p>In addition to destroying the hard drive, the complaint alleges that Guan concealed digital storage devices from investigators and falsely told federal officials that he had not had any contact with the Chinese consulate during his nearly two-year stay in the U.S.</p>\n<p>During his initial appearance this afternoon, Guan was ordered detained by a United States Magistrate Judge, who scheduled an arraignment for Sept. 17, 2020\u00a0.</p>\n<p>A criminal complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.

Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. \u00a0A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>John C.

Schiltz in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Shahidian, a citizen of Iran, was arrested in London, England on Nov. 11, 2018.\u00a0 On May 15, 2020, Shahidian was extradited to the United States and had his initial appearance in the District of Minnesota on May 18, 2020.</p>\n<p>According to the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and documents filed in court, Payment24 was an internet-based financial services company with approximately 40 employees and offices in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, Iran.\u00a0 The primary business of Payment24 was helping Iranian citizens conduct prohibited financial transactions with businesses based in the United States, including the unlawful purchase and exportation of computer software, software licenses, and computer servers from United States companies. \u00a0According to Payment24\u2019s website, the company charged a fee to circumvent \u201cAmerican sanctions,\u201d and claimed to have brought in millions of dollars of foreign currency into Iran.</p>\n<p>According to the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and documents filed in court, Shahidian, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Payment24, co-conspirator Vahid Vali, and other individuals violated the restrictions on trade and exports from the United States to Iran. \u00a0On its website, Payment24 sold a package to assist its Iranian clients with making online purchases from United States-based businesses, which included a PayPal account, a fraudulent \u201cID card and address receipt,\u201d a remote IP address from the United Arab Emirates, and a Visa gift card. \u00a0The Payment24 website also offered its clients advice on how to create accounts with a foreign identity and how to avoid restrictions on foreign websites, including advising clients to \u201cnever attempt to log into those sites with an Iranian IP address.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and documents filed in court, Shahidian admitted to making material misrepresentations and omissions to United States-based businesses regarding the destination of the United States-origin goods. In order to accomplish the transactions, Shahidian obtained payment processing accounts from United States-based companies like PayPal using fraudulent passports and other false residency documentation to falsely represent that his customers resided outside of Iran.\u00a0 Shahidian admitted to opening hundreds of PayPal accounts on behalf of his Payment24 customers who resided in Iran and to unlawfully bringing millions of U.S. dollars into the economy of Iran.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized exports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States or by a United States person are prohibited.</p>\n<p>This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Minneapolis Division of the FBI. \u00a0The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the FBI are particularly grateful for the substantial assistance provided by law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom, including the National Crime Agency and London Metropolitan Police, in connection with the arrest and extradition in this matter.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy C.

Ltd. (NHK Spring), which has pleaded guilty and been sentenced to pay a $28.5 million fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment, filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that, from at least as early as May 2008 and continuing until at least April 2016, Hashimoto and Tamura participated in a conspiracy with their competitors to stabilize, maintain, and fix the prices of suspension assemblies used in hard disk drives. \u00a0The conspirators accomplished their scheme by, among other things, agreeing to refrain from competing on prices and allocating their respective market shares.\u00a0 The conspirators also exchanged pricing information including anticipated pricing quotes, which they used to inform their negotiations with U.S. and foreign customers that purchased suspension assemblies and produced hard disk drives for sale in, or delivery to, the United States and elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis charge demonstrates that antitrust violations are not just corporate offenses but also crimes by individuals,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe Antitrust Division is committed to prosecuting culpable senior executives who circumvent the antitrust laws in order to cheat consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI, through its International Corruption Unit, is dedicated to ensuring the U.S. market remains free and open,\u201d said Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThe individuals indicted yesterday tried to cheat the system and unfairly profit at the expense of American consumers.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThis indictment underscores that seeking to obscure virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime, and that the Department can and will ensure that such crime doesn\u2019t pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor those who seek to use Darknet-based cryptocurrency tumblers, these charges should serve as a reminder that law enforcement, through its partnerships and collaboration, will uncover illegal activity and charge those responsible for unlawful acts,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe brazenness with which Helix operated should be the most appalling aspect of this operation to every day citizens.\u00a0 There are bad actors and then there are criminals who facilitate hundreds of other crimes,\u201d said Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation.\u00a0 \u201cThe sole purpose of Harmon\u2019s operation was to conceal criminal transactions from law enforcement on the Darknet, and because of our growing expertise in this area, he could not make good on that promise.\u00a0 Working in tandem with other sites, he sought to be the \u2018go-to\u2019 money launderer on the Darknet, but our investigators once again played the role of criminal disrupters, unraveling the interlinked web from one tentacle to another.\u00a0 We thank the Belizean authorities and other law enforcement agencies for their assistance on this case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency and the Darknet may appeal to criminals as a refuge to hide their illicit activity,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Timothy M. Dunham of the Criminal Division of the FBI Washington Field Office. \u00a0\u201cHowever, as this arrest demonstrates, the FBI and our law enforcement partners are committed to bringing the illegal practices of money launderers and other financial criminals to light and to justice, regardless of whether they are using new technological means to carry out their schemes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that Helix moved over 350,000 bitcoin \u2013 valued at over $300 million at the time of the transactions \u2013 on behalf of customers, with the largest volume coming from Darknet markets.\u00a0 Helix partnered with the Darknet market AlphaBay to provide bitcoin laundering services for AlphaBay customers.\u00a0 AlphaBay was one of the largest Darknet marketplaces in operation at the time that it was seized by law enforcement in July 2017.</p>\n<p>The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The investigation was led by the IRS-CI and the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office with assistance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. \u00a0The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs of the Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Ohio, IRS Field Offices of Washington, D.C.; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Oakland, California; and the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division and Field Offices of Cleveland, Ohio \u2014 Akron Resident Agency; Newark, New Jersey; and San Francisco, California \u2014 San Jose Resident Agency and the Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service provided essential support for the operation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Internationally, the Belize Ministry of the Attorney General and the Belize National Police Department simultaneously executed a search warrant of a residence allegedly leased by Harmon in Belize as U.S. authorities executed warrants in the United States.\u00a0 U.S. law enforcement agencies, coordinated by U.S. Embassy Belmopan, assisted in the Belize action.\u00a0 \u201cThese actions underscore the vital importance of working closely with our law enforcement partners in Belize to make both of our countries more safe and secure,\u201d said U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, a.i.

Chuang to conspiracy to advertise child pornography. \u00a0In his plea agreement, Marques admitted that between July 24, 2008, and July 29, 2013, he conspired to advertise child pornography by operating an anonymous web hosting service (AHS).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Marques was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-dark-web-child-pornography-facilitator-extradited-united-states-face-federal-charges\"><u>extradited</u></a> to the United States by Irish authorities on March 23, 2019.\u00a0 He was indicted in a four-count indictment alleging that he conspired to, and did advertise and distribute child pornography, between July 24, 2008 and July 29, 2013, by operating the AHS.\u00a0 Sentencing is scheduled for May 11.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendant\u2019s anonymous web service hosted dozens of insidious criminal communities dedicated to the sexual exploitation of children and spread millions of images of that abuse,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cHis guilty plea is proof of the department\u2019s fierce commitment to rooting out those who hide behind anonymous networks to commit serious child exploitation offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChild pornography is created by documenting the sexual abuse of children,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur of the District of Maryland.\u00a0 \u201cThis is an egregious case where one individual facilitated the abuse of more than a million new child victims and attempted to keep the abuse hidden on the dark web.\u00a0 We must do everything we can to bring individuals like Marques to justice in order to keep our children safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s guilty plea validates the FBI\u2019s unwavering commitment to stop those who sexually exploit innocent children,\u201d said Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cThe FBI and its international law enforcement partners will remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice for the world\u2019s most vulnerable victims harmed at the ruthless hands of others.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, between July 24, 2008 and July 29, 2013, Marques operated a free anonymous hosting service located on the \u201cdark web,\u201d an area of the Internet that is only accessible by means of special software, allowing users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable.\u00a0 The hosting service hosted websites that allowed users to view and share images documenting the sexual abuse of children, including the abuse of prepubescent minors, violent sexual abuse and bestiality. \u00a0The investigation revealed that the hosting service contained over 8.5 million images of child exploitation material and over 1.97 million of these images and/or videos involved victims that were not known by law enforcement. \u00a0As of July 12, 2013, one child exploitation website hosted on the hosting service reported nearly 1.4 million files were uploaded and accessible by individuals who visited that hidden service.</p>\n<p>During 2012 and 2013, FBI special agents and employees using computers in Maryland downloaded more than one million files from that website.\u00a0 As part of the investigation, those files were reviewed and nearly all of the files depict children who are engaging in sexually explicit conduct with adults or other children, posed nude and/or in such a manner as to expose their genitals, in various state of undress, or depict child erotica.\u00a0 A substantial majority of the images downloaded by the FBI depict prepubescent minor children who are fully or partially nude or engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p>This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.\u00a0 Led by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices and the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.

GSA Auctions sells that equipment via its online auctions, and the proceeds of the auctions are distributed to the government agencies or the U.S. Treasury general fund. \u00a0According to the charge, the primary purpose of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition. \u00a0Additionally, the co-conspirators obtained the equipment by agreeing which co-conspirators would submit bids for particular lots offered for sale by GSA Auctions and which co-conspirator would be designated to win a particular lot.</p>\n<p>Gaines is charged with violating the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million criminal fine for individuals.\u00a0 The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.\u00a0 An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>The ongoing investigation into bid rigging at GSA auctions is being conducted by the Antitrust Division\u2019s Chicago Office and the GSA Office of Inspector General\u2019s Great Lakes Regional Investigations Office in Chicago, Illinois. \u00a0Anyone with information concerning bid rigging or fraud related to GSA auctions should contact the Chicago Office of the Antitrust Division at 312-984-7200, the Antitrust Division\u2019s Citizen Complaint Center at 888-647-3258, visit <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/atr/report-violations\"><u>http://www.justice.gov/atr/report-violations</u></a> or email the GSA Office of Inspector General at <a href=\"mailto:fraudnet@gsaig.gov\">fraudnet@gsaig.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 Learn more about the history of our agency at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/Celebrating150Years\"><u>www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years</u></a>.</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Department of Justice announced today that Sajmir Alimehmeti, aka \u201cAbdul Qawii,\u201d 26, was sentenced to 22 years in prison based on convictions for attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), and\u00a0attempting to fraudulently procure a U.S. passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism.\u00a0 Alimehmeti pleaded guilty on Feb. 21, 2018, before U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, who imposed today\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlimehmeti was determined to support ISIS.\u00a0 He attempted to travel overseas to support the terrorist group, he assisted another person he believed to be a fellow ISIS supporter to prepare to purportedly travel to join ISIS, he lied on his passport application so he could get a clean passport to ease his efforts to travel overseas to join ISIS, and while in pretrial detention, he conspired with another terrorist to spread ISIS propaganda.\u00a0 With today\u2019s sentence, he is being held accountable for his crimes,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThe National Security Division will continue to work with our partners to identify, disrupt and hold accountable those who seek to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\u00a0 I want to thank the agents, analysts, and prosecutors who are responsible for this case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBronx resident Sajmir Alimehmeti took the position of an adversary to the United States and its values.\u00a0 Alimehmeti\u2019s contempt for the U.S. led him to travel overseas to support ISIS\u2019s terror campaign, eventually purchasing military-type weapons and assisting another to get travel documents, equipment, and encryption technology to fight with ISIS in Syria,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York. \u00a0\u201cEven after his incarceration, Alimemehti continued his supportive conduct for ISIS by working with convicted Chelsea bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi, to distribute ISIS propaganda in prison. \u00a0I sincerely commend our law enforcement partners for their commitment to detecting and apprehending those who support the disruption of American life through brazen acts of terrorism.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSajmir Alimehmeti was so committed to supporting and furthering the ISIS agenda, that when his multiple attempts to travel overseas raised enough red flags to deny him entry, he turned to assisting someone he thought shared his same objective. Unbeknownst to him, however, that someone was an undercover employee,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing is a welcome end to this case, and another successful outcome for the many agents, detectives, and analysts on FBI\u2019s JTTF in New York. Their work and our extensive partnerships are essential to keeping New York City and the nation safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSajmir Alimehmeti betrayed the country he called home by trying to travel overseas to join ISIS, a brutal terrorist group at war with the United States,\u201d said NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea. \u201cWhen that failed, Alimehmeti deliberately assisted another individual he believed was traveling to join ISIS. At the same time, the investigation revealed he was acquiring tactical knives, handcuffs and equipment indicative of efforts to prepare for an attack here in New York City. This case is another example of the relentless efforts of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Bureau to prevent terrorism before it occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p>As reflected in the criminal Complaint, Superseding Indictment, court filings, and statements during court proceedings:</p>\n<p>In October 2014, Alimehmeti attempted to enter the United Kingdom but was denied entry after U.K. authorities found camouflage clothing and nunchucks in his luggage.\u00a0 About two months later, in December 2014, Alimehmeti was again denied entry into the United Kingdom, this time after U.K. authorities found that his cellphone contained images of ISIS flags.\u00a0 Further forensic examination of the contents of the cellphone and Alimehmeti\u2019s laptop computer showed numerous indicia of Alimehmeti\u2019s support for ISIS, including a photograph of Alimehmeti with an ISIS flag in the background, images of ISIS fighters in the Middle East, a photograph of Alimehmeti making a gesture of support for ISIS, various files relating to jihad and martyrdom, and an online messaging exchange in which Alimehmeti attempted to assist another ISIS supporter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, by providing contact information for an ISIS affiliate who could facilitate the travel.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States, Alimehmeti continued to support ISIS.\u00a0 Among other things, Alimehmeti displayed an ISIS flag in his apartment in the Bronx and, in the course of recorded meetings with undercover law enforcement employees, Alimehmeti played multiple pro-ISIS propaganda videos on his computer and his cellphone, including videos of ISIS fighters decapitating prisoners, and Alimehmeti also indicated that he was interested in radicalizing other individuals in the Bronx area.\u00a0 Alimehmeti also made repeated purchases of combat knives and other military-type equipment, including masks, handcuffs, a pocket chainsaw, a wire pocket saw, and a rucksack designed for tactical combat.\u00a0 Alimehmeti stockpiled such equipment at his apartment in the Bronx.</p>\n<p>In October 2015, Alimehmeti applied for a U.S. passport, falsely claiming in the application that his previous passport had been lost.\u00a0 Alimehmeti later told an undercover law enforcement employee that his prior passport had not been lost and, instead, that he was applying for a new passport because he believed the rejection stamps in his existing passport resulting from his attempted entries into the United Kingdom would make it difficult to travel to ISIS territory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In May 2016, Alimehmeti attempted to assist an individual who was purportedly traveling from New York to Syria to train and fight with ISIS but who was actually an undercover law enforcement employee (the \u201cUC\u201d).\u00a0 On May 17, 2016, Alimehmeti met with the UC in Manhattan.\u00a0 Alimehmeti helped the UC locate stores so the UC could purchase supplies to use while traveling to, and fighting with, ISIS, including a cellphone, boots, a compass, a bag, and a flashlight, among other items.\u00a0 Alimehmeti then brought the UC to a hotel in Queens so the UC could purportedly meet with an individual who was preparing travel documents that the UC would use to travel to Syria to join ISIS.\u00a0 Alimehmeti gave the UC a piece of paper with his name and contact information, and asked the UC to provide that information to the purported document facilitator.\u00a0 Alimeheti explained that he wanted to travel to Syria and join ISIS, stating \u201cI\u2019m ready to . . . go with you man . . . you know I would.\u00a0 I\u2019m done with this place.\u201d\u00a0 After leaving the hotel in Queens, Alimeheti brought the UC to JFK Airport, via public transportation, so the UC could begin the purported journey to ISIS.</p>\n<p>Following Alimehmeti\u2019s arrest on the charges in this case in May 2016, the FBI executed a search of Alimehmeti\u2019s Bronx apartment pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant.\u00a0 The FBI found in the apartment, among other things, an ISIS flag that was displayed on a wall in the apartment.</p>\n<p>In 2017, while Alimehmeti was incarcerated and awaiting trial, law enforcement learned that Alimehmeti had worked with Ahmad Khan Rahimi inside the prison to aggregate and distribute terrorist propaganda that was part of the evidence in their respective cases and produced to them during discovery.\u00a0 Rahimi was sentenced to life in prison, in February 2018, for planting a series of bombs in New York and New Jersey in September 2016.\u00a0 Law enforcement also intercepted a letter that Alimhemeti sent to Rahimi, after their propaganda-distribution scheme inside the jail was thwarted, in which Alimehmeti referred to himself as the \u201cISIS balla,\u201d indicated that he had destroyed evidence of their propaganda distribution efforts, and expressed hope that both convicted terrorists would ultimately achieve so-called martyrdom through another act of terrorism.</p>\n<p>In addition to the prison term, Alimehmeti was also sentenced to five years supervised release.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Demers and Mr. Berman praised the outstanding efforts of the FBI\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, which principally consists of agents from the FBI and detectives from the New York City Police Department, the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Division, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the Albania State Police, and the Metropolitan Police Service\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command of London, United Kingdom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This prosecution is being handled by the Office\u2019s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Emil J. Bove III and George D. Turner are in charge of the case, with assistance from Trial Attorney Joseph Attias of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section.</p></div>",

After the defendants had compromised military members\u2019 bank accounts and veterans\u2019 benefits payments, Boling allegedly worked with co-defendant Trorice Crawford to recruit individuals who would accept the deposit of stolen funds into their bank accounts and then send the funds through international wire remittance services to the defendants and others.\u00a0 Evidence of the defendants\u2019 scheme was detected earlier this year, advancing the investigation that led to the indictment.</p>\n<p>The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are coordinating with the Department of Justice to notify and provide resources to the thousands of identified victims.\u00a0 Announcements also will follow regarding steps taken to secure military members\u2019 information and benefits from theft and fraud.</p>\n<p>Boling, Crawford, Kerr and Seok are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.\u00a0 Crawford remains in federal custody pending resolution of this litigation.\u00a0 Boling, Kerr and Seok are in custody in the Philippines awaiting transfer to the Western District of Texas.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that an indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed.\u00a0 All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>The United States is represented by Trial Attorneys Ehren Reynolds and Yolanda McCray Jones of the Department of Justice\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Blackwell of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas.\u00a0 The matter was investigated by agents of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and counsel Matthew Freund, along with substantial investigative support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, and the Veterans Benefits Administration\u2019s Benefits Protection and Remediation Division.\u00a0 The U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, Philippine law enforcement partners, and the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for the District of Nevada, the Southern District of California, and the Eastern District of Virginia also provided assistance.\u00a0 Resources from the Department of Justice\u2019s Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative and its Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force aided in the matter\u2019s investigation and prosecution.</p>\n<p>Since President Trump signed the bipartisan Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (EAPPA) into law, the Department of Justice has participated in hundreds of enforcement actions in criminal and civil cases that targeted or disproportionately affected seniors.\u00a0 In particular, this past March the Department announced the largest elder fraud enforcement action in American history,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-coordinates-largest-ever-nationwide-elder-fraud-sweep-0?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">charging more than 260 defendants in a nationwide elder fraud sweep</a>.\u00a0 The Department has likewise conducted hundreds of trainings and outreach sessions across the country since the passage of the Act.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>An employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was arrested today on charges related to his alleged disclosure of classified national defense information (NDI) to two journalists in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs laid out in today\u2019s indictment, Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u00a0\u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people\u2014a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country. This is one of six unauthorized disclosure cases the Department has charged in just over two years, and we will continue in our efforts to punish and deter this behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>Henry Kyle Frese, 30, of Alexandria, is a DIA employee and holds a Top Secret//Sensitive Compartmented Information U.S. government security clearance. According to court documents, between mid-April and early May 2018, Frese allegedly accessed classified intelligence reports, some of which were unrelated to his job duties, and provided TOP SECRET information regarding a foreign country\u2019s weapons systems to a journalist (Journalist 1).\u00a0 According to court documents, Frese and Journalist 1 had the same residential address from August 2017 through August 2018 and, based on reviews of Frese\u2019s and Journalist 1\u2019s public social media pages, it appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time. \u00a0The unauthorized disclosure of TOP SECRET information could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, a week after Frese accessed one of the intelligence reports (Intelligence Report 1) for the second time, Journalist 1 wrote to Frese on April 27, 2018, and asked whether he would be willing to speak with another journalist (Journalist 2). Frese stated that he was \u201cdown\u201d to help Journalist 2 if it helped Journalist 1 because he wanted to see Journalist 1 \u201cprogress.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged, in that same communication, Frese and Journalist 1 also discussed a story that Journalist 1 was working on, the subject matter of which was the topic of Intelligence Report 1.\u00a0 Several days after that communication, Frese searched on a classified United States government computer system for terms related to the topics contained in Intelligence Report 1.\u00a0 According to the indictment, in the hours after searching for terms related to the topic of Intelligence Report 1, Frese spoke by telephone with both Journalist 1 (twice) and Journalist 2, and within approximately a half hour after Frese\u2019s conversations with the two journalists, Journalist 1 published an article (Article 1) through News Outlet 1, which contained NDI from Intelligence Report 1 classified at the TOP SECRET//SCI level.</p>\n<p>In addition, as alleged in the indictment, on Sept. 24, 2019, Frese was captured on court-authorized surveillance of his cell phone orally transmitting classified NDI to Journalist 2. These disclosures contained NDI classified at the SECRET level, meaning that the unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause serious harm to the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\u201cHenry Kyle Frese was entrusted with TOP SECRET information related to the national defense of our country,\u201d said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \u201cFrese allegedly violated that trust, the oath he swore to uphold, and is charged with engaging in dastardly and felonious conduct at the expense of our country. This indictment should serve as a clear reminder to all of those similarly entrusted with National Defense Information that unilaterally disclosing such information for personal gain, or that of others, is not selfless or heroic, it is criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Frese allegedly disclosed highly classified national defense information, which puts our country and people at risk,\" said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Washington Field Office Counterintelligence Division.\u00a0 \"He violated his oath to serve and protect the United States.\u00a0 The men and women of the FBI work hard every day to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution - we will not stand by while trusted government employees violate that trust in such an egregious way.\"</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment yesterday charging Frese with two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Danya E. Atiyeh and Trial Attorney Jennifer Kennedy Gellie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe Department of Justice will continue to use every tool at our disposal, including data analytics and traditional law enforcement techniques, to investigate, prosecute, and punish this reprehensible behavior and protect federal programs from abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs today\u2019s takedown demonstrates, this Strike Force has produced precisely what we hoped it would \u2013 and by that I mean tangible results,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William M.

Kennedy Jr. of the Western District of New York. \u201cWhen such professionals abandon that obligation and instead engage in acts of fraud and deceit, they will be prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, defendants charged in the Eastern District of New York used fraud and deceit to steal Medicaid and Medicare funds meant to protect our elderly and most vulnerable residents,\u201d stated U.S. Attorney Donoghue of the Eastern District of New York.\u00a0 \u201cAs this initiative demonstrates, we will continue to bring to justice those that defraud our nation\u2019s health care programs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to identify, investigate and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in the nation\u2019s federal healthcare programs,\u201d said Deputy Administrator and CPI Center Director Alec Alexander. \u00a0\u201cIn this case, CMS will take swift administrative action against providers responsible for fraudulent billings to federal healthcare programs. \u00a0CMS is committed to protecting vulnerable beneficiaries from exploitation and safeguarding taxpayer dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI does not care about your status in life, your professional standing, your level of income, or your personal connections when you break the law,\" said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Wayne Jacobs of the FBI\u2019s Newark Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cIf you try to scam the system, if you exploit your professional license just to pad your pockets, if you mortgage your morals just to inflate your bank account, you will only find yourself in deeper debt.\u00a0 We are committed to protecting the public; we are intent on rooting out fraud and corruption; we are duty-bound to track down and arrest anyone who is breaking our federal laws.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealthcare fraud is not a victimless crime\u2014with unscrupulous providers preying on Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers alike.\u00a0 Especially insidious is the fraud committed by healthcare professionals who are trusted to provide needed, quality services to patients,\u201d\u00a0said Special Agent in Charge Scott J. Lampert of HHS-OIG.\u00a0 \u201cWith our law enforcement partners, our agency will continue to thoroughly investigate medical providers and others involved in healthcare fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe physicians who chose to violate their oaths to \u201cDo no harm\u201d are nothing more than drug dealers wearing a white lab coat,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Susan A. Gibson of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s New Jersey Field Division. \u00a0\u201cThey have turned their backs on those most vulnerable. \u00a0We will continue to vigorously pursue these doctors who violate the faith and trust of those who need help.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>*********</b></p>\n<p>Among those charged in the District of New Jersey are the following:</p>\n<p>Elliot Loewenstern, 56, of Boca Raton, Florida, the vice president of marketing of purported call centers and telemedicine companies, pleaded guilty on Sept. 24, 2019, for his role in one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever investigated by the FBI and HHS-OIG and prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which resulted in charges in April 2019 against 24 defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 Loewenstern pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and pay and receive health care kickbacks, and one count of solicitation of health care kickbacks.\u00a0 Loewenstern was the Vice President of Marketing of PCS CC LLC and a marketer for Video Doctor USA (Video Doctor) and Telemed Health Group LLC (AffordADoc) (collectively, the Video Doctor Network).\u00a0 In connection with his plea agreement, Loewenstern admitted causing the submission of over $424 million in fraudulent claims that resulted from the solicitation of illegal kickbacks and bribes in exchange for the referral of brace orders to brace providers.\u00a0 In connection with his guilty plea, Loewenstern admitted that he and others agreed to solicit and receive illegal kickbacks and bribes from patient recruiters, brace suppliers and others in exchange for the arranging for doctors to order medically unnecessary orthotic braces for beneficiaries of Medicare and other insurance carriers.\u00a0 The beneficiaries were contacted through an international telemarketing network that lured hundreds of thousands of elderly and/or disabled patients into a criminal scheme that crossed borders, involving call centers in the Philippines and throughout Latin America, Loewenstern stated.\u00a0 Loewenstern admitted that many of these orders were written after only a short telephone call between the health care provider and the beneficiary, with whom the health care provider had no prior doctor-patient relationship.\u00a0 In addition, Loewenstern admitted that he was aware that the owners and other executives of the Video Doctor Network schemed to defraud investors and others by making false and fraudulent representations that the Video Doctor Network was a legitimate telemedicine enterprise that made revenue of \u201c$10 million per year\u201d and \u201c20 percent profit\u201d from payments by beneficiaries who enrolled in a membership program and paid for the telemedicine consultations.\u00a0 These statements were false because revenue was obtained by the Video Doctor Network through the receipt of illegal kickbacks and bribes, Loewenstern admitted.\u00a0 In connection with his plea agreement, Loewenstern agreed to pay $200 million in restitution to the United States, as well as forfeit assets and property traceable to proceeds of the conspiracy to defraud the United States.\u00a0 Loewenstern\u2019s sentencing is set for Jan. 9, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo of the District of New Jersey, who accepted his plea.\u00a0 Loewenstern was charged along with Creaghan Harry, 51, of Highland Beach, Florida, and Lester Stockett, 52, of Medellin, Colombia, in an indictment charging one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and pay and receive health care kickbacks and four counts of health care kickbacks.\u00a0 Stockett and Harry were separately charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.\u00a0 Stockett, the Chief Executive Officer, previously entered a plea of guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of money laundering.\u00a0 The case against Harry is pending.\u00a0 Trial has not been set.\u00a0 The case was investigated by FBI, HHS-OIG, and IRS-CI.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Acting Assistant Chief Jacob Foster and Trial Attorney Darren Halverson of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section.</p>\n<p>Joseph DeCoroso, M.D., 62, of Toms River, New Jersey, pleaded guilty for his role in a $13 million conspiracy to commit health care fraud and separate charges of health care fraud for writing medically unnecessary orders for durable medical equipment (DME), in many instances without ever speaking to the patients, while working for two telemedicine companies.\u00a0 Sentencing is set for Jan. 8, 2020.\u00a0 The case was investigated by FBI Newark and HHS-OIG.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Acting Assistant Chief Jacob Foster and Trial Attorney Darren Halverson.</p>\n<p>Nelly Petrosyan, 56, of New York, New York, the owner and operator of orthotic brace suppliers in New York, New York, was indicted\u00a0 on one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to pay and receive health care kickbacks and three counts of payment of health care kickbacks.\u00a0 The charges result from a $5.6 million conspiracy in which Petrosyan offered and paid kickbacks and bribes to several purported telemedicine companies in exchange for completed doctors\u2019 orders of medically unnecessary orthotic braces for Medicare beneficiaries.\u00a0 Petrosyan and her coconspirators concealed the fraud by entering into sham contracts and producing false invoices characterizing the kickbacks and bribes as payments for \u201cmarketing.\u201d\u00a0 The investigation was conducted by FBI Newark and HHS-OIG.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Darren Halverson.</p>\n<p>Alice Chu, M.D., 62, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and four counts of health care fraud.\u00a0 The charges stem from Chu\u2019s alleged submission of false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and private insurance companies for services that were medically unnecessary, never provided, not provided as represented or not eligible for reimbursement.\u00a0 Chu was allegedly induced by a financial incentive to order expensive and medically unnecessary lab tests that were paid for by Medicare.\u00a0 The investigation was conducted by FBI Newark, HHS-OIG, DOD-DCIS and FDA-OIC.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Rebecca Yuan of the Fraud Section.</p>\n<p>Aaron Williamsky 59, of Marlboro, New Jersey, and Nadia Levit, 40, of Englishtown, New Jersey, owners of approximately 25 durable medical equipment companies, pleaded guilty on Sept. 18 and Sept. 25, respectively, for their participation in a health care fraud scheme related to their payment of kickbacks in exchange for doctors\u2019 orders for medically unnecessary orthotic braces.\u00a0 Levit\u2019s conduct admittedly caused losses in excess of $120 million and Williamsky\u2019s conduct admittedly caused losses in excess of $170 million. \u00a0Williamsky also pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy related to his attempt to conceal at least $1.65 million of the proceeds of the fraud.\u00a0 The case was investigated by FBI, HHS-OIG, and IRS-CI.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean Sherman and Stephen Ferketic of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Bernard Ogon, M.D., 46, of Burlington, New Jersey, pleaded guilty on Sept. 25 to one count of health care fraud conspiracy for his participation in a vast compounded medication telemedicine conspiracy.\u00a0 As part of the conspiracy, Ogon admittedly signed prescriptions for compounded medications (that is, medications with ingredients of a drug tailored to the needs of a particular patient) without having established a doctor-patient relationship, spoken to the patient or conducting any medical evaluation.\u00a0 Ogon often signed preprinted prescription forms\u2014with patient information and medication already filled out\u2014where all that was required was his signature.\u00a0 Then, instead of providing the prescription to the patient, Ogon would return the prescriptions to specific compounding pharmacies involved in the conspiracy.\u00a0 Ogon was paid $20 to $30 for each prescription he signed, and his participation in the conspiracy caused losses to health care benefit programs of over $24 million, including losses to government health care programs of over $7 million.\u00a0 The case was investigated by FBI Newark and HHS-OIG.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Gould of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Joseph Santiamo, 64, of Staten Island, New York, a physician specializing in internal medicine and geriatrics was charged for allegedly conspiring to distribute and dispense controlled substances, including oxycodone, in exchange for sexual favors, and outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Urbano of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Yana Shtindler, 44, of Glen Head, New York; Samuel \u201cSam\u201d Khaimov, 47, of Glen Head, New York; Alex Fleyshmakher, 33, of Morganville, New Jersey; and Ruben Sevumyants 36, of Marlboro, New Jersey were indicted in connection with a scheme at Prime Aid Pharmacies (located in Union City, New Jersey and Bronx, New York) that included: (a) paying illegal bribes and kickbacks to doctors and doctors\u2019 employees in exchange for prescription referrals to Prime Aid; (b) billing health insurance providers for medications that were never actually provided to patients; and (c) opening new pharmacies and concealing the true ownership of those pharmacies to obtain lucrative contracts they otherwise would not have obtained.\u00a0 The scheme of billing for medications that were never dispensed to patients was so egregious that Prime Aid received reimbursement payments of over $65 million for prescription medications that it never even ordered from distributors or had in stock.\u00a0 In total, Prime Aid\u2019s multiple schemes defrauded Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers out of at least $99 million.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Haber of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Eduard \u201cEddy\u201d Shtindler, 36, the owner and operator of Empire Pharmacy in West New York, New Jersey, was charged by criminal complaint for paying bribes to a psychiatrist in Hudson County, New Jersey, to induce the doctor to send prescriptions to Empire. \u00a0On occasion, Shtindler secreted cash bribes in pill bottles that were delivered to the doctor. \u00a0In exchange for these bribes, the doctor steered patients to Empire pharmacy. In addition, starting in 2015, Empire \u2013 at Shtindler\u2019s direction \u2013 perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to induce doctors to send expensive specialty medication prescriptions to Empire. Specialty medications often required \u201cprior authorization\u201d before being approved for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid, and some private insurance providers. \u00a0To receive prior authorization approval more quickly and successfully than any other pharmacies, Empire employees, including two pharmacists, repeatedly falsified prior authorization forms for medications for various conditions, including psoriasis and Hepatitis C. In total, Empire defrauded Medicare and Medicaid out of at least $2 million.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Haber of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Matthew S. Ellis, 53, of Gainesville, Florida; Edward B. Kostishion, 59, Lakeland, Florida; Kyle D. Mclean, 36, of Arlington Heights, Illinois; Kacey C. Plaisance, 38, of Altamonte Springs, Florida; Jeremy Richey, 39, of Mars, Pennsylvania, and Jeffrey Tamulski, 46, of Tampa, Florida were indicted in connection with a genetic testing health care fraud scheme.\u00a0 Kostishion, Plaisance, and Richey operated Ark Laboratory Network LLC (Ark), a company that purported to operate a network of laboratories that facilitated genetic testing. \u00a0Ark partnered with Privy Health Inc., a company that McLean operated, and another company to acquire DNA samples and Medicare information from hundreds of patients through various methods, including offering $75 gift cards to patients, all without the involvement of a treating health care professional. \u00a0Ellis, a physician based in Gainesville, served as the ordering physician who authorized genetic testing for hundreds of patients across the country that he never saw, examined, or treated. \u00a0These included patients from New Jersey and various other states where Ellis was not licensed to practice medicine. Through this process, Ellis, Kostishion, Plaisance, and McLean submitted and caused to be submitted fraudulent orders for genetic tests to numerous clinical laboratories. \u00a0These orders falsely certified that Ellis was the patients\u2019 treating physician and, in many cases, contained false information indicating that a patient had a personal or family history of cancer, when, in fact, the patient had no cancer history whatsoever. \u00a0In 2018 alone, Medicare paid clinical laboratories at least approximately $4.6 million for genetic tests that Ellis ordered in this manner.\u00a0 In addition, Kostishion, Plaisance, Richey and Tamulski entered into kickback agreements with certain clinical laboratories under which the laboratories would pay Ark a bribe in exchange for delivering DNA samples and orders for genetic tests. \u00a0The bribe payments were based on the percentage of Medicare revenue that the laboratories received in connection with the tests. \u00a0Among other things, Kostishion, Plaisance, Richey, and Tamulski concealed these kickback arrangements through issuing sham invoices to laboratories that purportedly reflected services provided at an hourly rate even though the parties had already agreed upon the bribe amount, which was based on the revenue the laboratories received.\u00a0 In 2018, the clinical laboratories paid Ark at least approximately $1.8 in bribes.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernard Cooney of the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Among those charged in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania are the following:</p>\n<p>Timothy F. Shawl, 60, of Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, a medical doctor, was charged with five counts of unlawful distribution of controlled substances. \u00a0He allegedly wrote prescriptions for controlled substances that were outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. \u00a0Shawl allegedly wrote prescriptions for controlled substances for patients without seeing, treating or examining them.\u00a0 Shawl allegedly prescribed hundreds of prescriptions for oxycodone to approximately 16 patients amounting to over 29,000 oxycodone tablets. \u00a0The FBI conducted the investigation. \u00a0The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Debra Jaroslawicz of the Fraud Section.</p>\n<p>Neil K. Anand, M.D., 42, of Bensalem, Pennsylavia, and Asif Kundi, 31, Atif Mahmood Malik, 34, and Viktoriya Makarova, 33, all of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, \u00a0Anand, a medical doctor, Kundi and Malik, unlicensed foreign medical school graduates, and Makarova, a nurse practitioner, were indicted on one count of health care fraud and one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. \u00a0The charges stem from the defendants\u2019 alleged submission of false and fraudulent claims to Medicare, health plans provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Independence Blue Cross (IBC).\u00a0 The claims allegedly were \u00a0for \u201cGoody Bags,\u201d bags of medically unnecessary prescription medications that were dispensed by non-pharmacy dispensing sites owned by Anand. \u00a0In total, Medicare, OPM and IBC allegedly paid over $4 million for the Goody Bags. \u00a0Patients were allegedly required to take the Goody Bags in order to receive prescriptions for controlled substances. Malik and Kundi allegedly wrote prescriptions for controlled substances using blank prescriptions that were pre-signed by Anand or Makarova. \u00a0Anand and Makarova allegedly prescribed over 10,000 prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances, of which over 7,000 were for oxycodone totaling over 634,000 oxycodone tablets. \u00a0The investigation was conducted by the FBI, HHS-OIG, USPS-OIG and OPM. \u00a0The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Debra Jaroslawicz.</p>\n<p>Twelve indictments were unsealed involving charges against 12 people for allegedly possessing oxycodone with intent to distribute.\u00a0 The indictments charge that, from September 2016 through June 2019, the 12 defendants all presented forged prescriptions for oxycodone to various pharmacies outside of Philadelphia, in order to obtain oxycodone to distribute to others.\u00a0 The defendants, all from Philadelphia, drove many miles to pharmacies in Mt.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cAs we continue to dedicate resources to battle healthcare and opioid fraud schemes in Texas and elsewhere, we are shining an inescapable light on dirty doctors, clinic owners, pharmacists, and others who may have long believed they could perpetrate their frauds behind closed doors.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHealthcare should revolve around patients\u2019 well-being \u2013 not providers\u2019 personal interests,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox of the Northern District of Texas. \u00a0\u201cWhen medical professionals line their own pockets by submitting false insurance claims or prescribing unnecessary medications, equipment, or treatments, it not only drains taxpayer coffers \u2013 but it makes healthcare more expensive for everyone else. \u00a0We cannot allow the healthcare industry to become bloated by fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSadly, opioid proliferation is nothing new to Americans,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern District of Texas. \u00a0\u201cWhat is new, is the reinforced fight being taken to dirty doctors and shady pharmacists. \u00a0Texas may have four U.S. Attorneys, but we are focused on one health care mission: shutting down pills mills and rooting out corruption in health care. From Lufkin to Laredo and Dallas to Del Rio, one of us will shut these operations down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery dollar stolen from Medicare through fraud comes out of the pocket of taxpayers,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown of the Eastern District of Texas.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThese are real costs that help drive up the cost of medical services for everyone.\u00a0 It is important that there be real consequences for those who cheat the system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am proud\u00a0to fight healthcare fraud in Texas alongside Ryan Patrick, Erin Nealy Cox, and Joe Brown,\u201d said U.S. Attorney John Bash of the Western District of Texas. \u00a0\u201cThese crimes drive up the cost of health insurance, waste tax revenue and threaten the well-being of Texans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese arrests across multiple investigations and jurisdictions is further proof that successful teamwork exemplifies Texas law enforcement,\u201d said DEA Houston Special Agent in Charge Will R. Glaspy. \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s operation affirms both our commitment to targeting those individuals who illegally divert opioids in our communities, and our collective will to bring those individuals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealth care fraud undermines our country by driving up medical costs, wasting taxpayer dollars, and often harming patients,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge C.J.

Huber, 61; Yoany Vaillant, aka Yoany Vaillant Fajardo, 38; and Luis Angel Villarino, 40, allegedly ran an entity called Jetflicks, an online subscription-based service headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, that permitted users to stream and, at times, download copyrighted television programs without the permission of the relevant copyright owners.</p>\n<p>The defendants reproduced tens of thousands of copyrighted television episodes without authorization, and distributed the infringing programs to tens of thousands of paid subscribers located throughout the U.S. \u00a0At one point, Jetflicks claimed to have more than 183,200 different television episodes.\u00a0 One of the defendants, Polo, left Jetflicks and created a competing site based in Las Vegas called iStreamItAll (ISIA) that at one point claimed to have 115,849 different television episodes and 10,511 individual movies.\u00a0 Like Jetflicks, ISIA offered content for a regular subscription fee to viewers around the United States, and ISIA publicly asserted that it had more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Amazon Prime.\u00a0 The two services were not only available to subscribers over the internet but specifically designed to work on many different types of devices, platforms and software including numerous varieties of computer operating systems, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, video game consoles, digital media players, set-top boxes and web browsers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition, the grand jury charged Dallmann with two counts of criminal copyright infringement by reproduction or distribution, two counts of criminal copyright by public performance and four counts of money laundering, and charged Polo with two counts of criminal copyright infringement by distributing a copyrighted work being prepared for commercial distribution, two counts of criminal copyright infringement by reproduction or distribution, two counts of criminal copyright infringement by public performance and four counts of money laundering.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Jetflicks allegedly obtained infringing television programs from pirate websites around the world\u2014including some of the globe\u2019s biggest torrent and Usenet sites specializing in infringing content such as The Pirate Bay, RARBG and Torrentz\u2014using various automated computer scripts, often providing episodes to subscribers the day after the shows originally aired on television.\u00a0 Specifically, the defendants allegedly used sophisticated computer code to scour global pirate sites for new illegal content to download, process and store the shows, and then make those episodes available on servers in the United States and Canada to Jetflicks subscribers for streaming and/or downloading.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Polo was allegedly part of the computer programming team that built Jetflicks but later left and started ISIA, a competing service based in Las Vegas that offered not only television programs but movies.\u00a0 Polo allegedly used many of the same automated tools that Jetflicks employed to locate, download, process and store illegal content, and then quickly make those television programs and movies available on servers in Canada to ISIA subscribers for streaming and/or downloading.\u00a0 In fact, some of the movies offered by ISIA were not yet available for authorized sale, download, or viewing outside a movie theater.</p>\n<p>The charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.</p>\n<p>The FBI conducted the investigation.\u00a0 Senior Counsel Matthew A.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cAs this case demonstrates, the Department of Justice is and will remain on the front lines of defending U.S. companies against the theft of their trade secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict makes clear that Shan Shi conspired to steal trade secrets by poaching employees from a U.S. company and enticing them to bring technical data to his company,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cHe did this against the backdrop of China\u2019s strategic plan to close the gap between China and United States in buoyancy technology and with the benefit of millions of dollars of funding from China. \u00a0Like our many other prosecutions implicating China\u2019s economic aggression, this case exemplifies both the threat to American companies and our commitment to confront it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe take very seriously the theft of intellectual property that was developed in the United States through long years of research, development, and innovation,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessie K.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald of the District of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>John L. Steele, 48, who pleaded guilty on March 6, 2017, was sentenced today before U.S. District Judge Joan N. Ericksen of the District of Minnesota who also ordered Steele to pay restitution in the amount of $1,541,527.37.</p>\n<p>According to his guilty plea and documents filed in court, between 2011 and 2014, Steele and his co-defendant Paul R. Hansmeier, both practicing lawyers, executed a scheme to obtain millions of dollars by threatening copyright lawsuits against individuals who allegedly downloaded pornographic movies from file-sharing websites. \u00a0Steele admitted in court during his plea that he and Hansmeier created a series of sham entities, which they surreptitiously controlled, to obtain copyrights to pornographic movies \u2013 some of which they filmed themselves \u2013 and then uploaded those movies to file-sharing websites like \u201cThe Pirate Bay\u201d in order to lure people to download the movies. \u00a0Steele and Hansmeier then filed bogus copyright infringement lawsuits that concealed both their role in distributing the movies, and their personal stake in the outcome of the litigation. \u00a0After filing the lawsuits, the defendants gained authority from the courts to subpoena internet service providers for identification information of the subscriber who controlled the IP address used to download the movie. \u00a0With that information, the defendants used extortionate tactics such as letters and phone calls to threaten victims with enormous financial penalties and public embarrassment unless they agreed to pay a $3,000 settlement fee.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the plea agreement and other court documents, in November 2011, in order to distance themselves from the specious lawsuits and any potential fallout, Steele and Hansmeier created and used Prenda Law, among other law firms, to pursue their fraudulent lawsuits. \u00a0Steele acknowledged at his plea hearing that he and Hansmeier exerted de facto control over Prenda Law throughout the scheme, but recruited a now-deceased Illinois attorney to pretend to own and control the law firm.</p>\n<p>In October 2012, the defendants changed their tactics and began filing lawsuits falsely alleging that computer systems belonging to their sham clients had been hacked. \u00a0To facilitate their phony \u201chacking\u201d lawsuits, the defendants recruited individuals who had been caught downloading pornography from a file-sharing website, to act as ruse \u201cdefendants.\u201d \u00a0These ruse defendants agreed to be sued and permit Steele and Hansmeier to conduct early discovery against their supposed \u201cco-conspirators\u201d in exchange for Steele and Hansmeier waiving their settlement fees. \u00a0During his plea hearing, Steele admitted that the allegations of \u201chacking\u201d in these complaints were made up.</p>\n<p>In total, Steele and Hansmeier obtained approximately $3 million from the fraudulent copyright lawsuits.</p>\n<p>This case was the result of an investigation conducted by the FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigations.</p>\n<p>Senior Counsel Brian Levine of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin F.

Assange, 47, the founder of WikiLeaks, with offenses that relate to Assange\u2019s alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.\u00a0 Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director John Brown of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division and Acting Assistant Director in Charge Timothy Dunham of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment alleges that Assange was complicit with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, in unlawfully obtaining and disclosing classified documents related to the national defense. \u00a0Specifically, the superseding indictment alleges that Assange \u00a0conspired with Manning;\u00a0 obtained from Manning and aided and abetted her in obtaining classified information with reason to believe that the information was to be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of a foreign nation;\u00a0 received and attempted to receive classified information having reason to believe that such materials would be obtained, taken, made, and disposed of by a person contrary to law; and \u00a0aided and abetted Manning in communicating classified documents to Assange.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After agreeing to receive classified documents from Manning and aiding, abetting, and causing Manning to provide classified documents, the superseding indictment charges that Assange then published on WikiLeaks classified documents that contained the unredacted names of human sources who provided information to United States forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to U.S. State Department diplomats around the world. \u00a0These human sources included local Afghans and Iraqis, journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents from repressive regimes. \u00a0According to the superseding indictment, Assange\u2019s actions risked serious harm to United States national security to the benefit of our adversaries and put the unredacted named human sources at a grave and imminent risk of serious physical harm and/or arbitrary detention.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment alleges that beginning in late 2009, Assange and WikiLeaks actively solicited United States classified information, including by publishing a list of \u201cMost Wanted Leaks\u201d that sought, among other things, classified documents. \u00a0Manning responded to Assange\u2019s solicitations by using access granted to her as an intelligence analyst to search for United States classified documents, and provided to Assange and WikiLeaks databases containing approximately 90,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related significant activities reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs, and 250,000 U.S. Department of State cables.</p>\n<p>Many of these documents were classified at the Secret level, meaning that their unauthorized disclosure could cause serious damage to United States national security.\u00a0 Manning also provided rules of engagement files for the Iraq war, most of which were also classified at the Secret level and which delineated the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces would initiate or conduct combat engagement with other forces.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment alleges that Manning and Assange engaged in real-time discussions regarding Manning\u2019s transmission of classified records to Assange. \u00a0The discussions also reflect that Assange actively encouraged Manning to provide more information and agreed to crack a password hash stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), a United States government network used for classified documents and communications.\u00a0 Assange is also charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to crack that password hash.</p>\n<p>Assange is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count except for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, for which he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. \u00a0Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. \u00a0A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S.

Assange, 47, the founder of WikiLeaks, was arrested today in the United Kingdom pursuant to the U.S./UK Extradition Treaty, in connection with a federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer.</p>\n<p>According to court documents unsealed today, the charge relates to Assange\u2019s alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that in March 2010, Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications. \u00a0Manning, who had access to the computers in connection with her duties as an intelligence analyst, was using the computers to download classified records to transmit to WikiLeaks. \u00a0Cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log on to the computers under a username that did not belong to her. \u00a0Such a deceptive measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to determine the source of the illegal disclosures.</p>\n<p>During the conspiracy, Manning and Assange engaged in real-time discussions regarding Manning\u2019s transmission of classified records to Assange. \u00a0The discussions also reflect Assange actively encouraging Manning to provide more information. \u00a0During an exchange, Manning told Assange that \u201cafter this upload, that\u2019s all I really have got left.\u201d \u00a0To which Assange replied, \u201ccurious eyes never run dry in my experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Assange is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted. \u00a0Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. \u00a0A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger for the Eastern District of Virginia and Assistant Director in Charge Nancy McNamara of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office made the announcement after the charges were unsealed. \u00a0First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S. Dwyer, Thomas W. Traxler and Gordon D. Kromberg, and Trial Attorneys Matthew R. Walczewski and Nicholas O. Hunter of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>The extradition will be handled by the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.\u00a0 Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.</p></div>",

The awarded officers and deputies have demonstrated active engagement with the community in one of three areas: criminal investigations, field operations or innovations in community policing. The Department received 207 nominations for 469 individuals ranging from state police departments, to local police, to campus public safety agencies. This award highlights the work that officers and deputies do to prevent, intervene in, and respond to crime and public safety issues. The individuals recognized today are listed below:</p>\n<p><b><u>INNOVATIONS IN COMMUNITY POLICING</u></b></p>\n<p><b>Sergeant Sean Crotty of the Little Egg Harbor Police Department,\u00a0New Jersey:</b></p>\n<p>Sergeant Sean Crotty is the school resource officer at the local high school. His main responsibility is the protection of the school community. However, he also takes on the arguably greater role of getting involved with students, shaping the way they view law enforcement, and helping mold them into productive community members. While Sergeant Crotty\u2019s \u201cbeat\u201d is the high school, this does not limit him to creating relationships with the younger students in the community. In his years with the department, Sergeant Crotty started a Junior Police Academy for middle school students, enhanced free Police Athletic League (PAL) programs, and added a Junior Police Explorers program.</p>\n<p><b>Detective John Rastetter of the Canton Police Department, Ohio: </b></p>\n<p>Detective Michael Rastetter\u2019s work with those suffering from opioid addiction has set him apart\u00a0 among a department full of dedicated officers continuously looking for innovative ways to serve their community. Detective Rastetter became the point person for the newly created Stark County Outreach Support (SOS) team, a quick response team made up of a nurse, a social worker and a vice detective. SOS has engaged 70 overdose survivors and 33 family members, connected 30 individuals with rehabilitation services and provided 19 Naloxone kits, leading to a reduction of nearly 60 percent in opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017. Detective Rastetter is a large part of the success of the program and decline in the overdose deaths.</p>\n<p><b>Officer Laurie Reyes of the Montgomery County Police Department, Maryland:</b></p>\n<p>Officer Laurie Reyes noticed that repeated searches for the same critically missing people (individuals with autism, intellectual and developmental disabilities [IDD], and Alzheimer\u2019s disease) demanded a large portion of departmental resources, both in money and in officers\u2019 time. She created the nationally recognized \u201cAutism, Intellectual, Developmental Disabilities, and Alzheimer\u2019s Outreach Program\u201d as a way to promote awareness and safety through education, outreach, follow-up, empowerment and response. Officer Reyes identified a problem and developed a creative solution, which had a significant impact on public safety and public trust, all at no additional fiscal cost to the agency.</p>\n<p><b><u>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS</u></b></p>\n<p><b>Officer Megan Freer of the Middleton Township Police Department, Pennsylvania:</b></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2017, a 19-year-old man went missing near Middletown Township. Officer Freer began an intensive investigation into the missing person case, which eventually led to the discovery of a horrific quadruple homicide in Solebury Township, about 20 miles away. Officer Freer\u2019s incredible investigative efforts led to the arrest of two 20-year-olds charged with murder of the four young men, and providing closure for the families of those missing young men. This was a tremendous effort of policing and police investigation, and Officer Freer has received several awards for her investigative effort, including the Philadelphia National Liberty Museum Award of Valor in September 2017.</p>\n<p><b>Detective Andrew Beuschel, Jr. of the Evesham Township Police Department, New Jersey: </b></p>\n<p>In December 2017, a father called the police when he found his 15-year-old daughter unresponsive due to a possible drug overdose; an ambulance transported the victim to the hospital, where she subsequently died from a heroin overdose two days later. Detective Beuschel investigated the case, including interviews and evidence from numerous warrants on cell phones, computers, and social media accounts, and was able to locate the suspected seller. Detective Beuschel\u2019s persistence led to arrest warrants for possession of heroin, distribution of heroin, and ultimately, strict liability of the suspect for the drug-induced death of the 15-year-old victim.</p>\n<p><b>Trooper Joel D. Follmer of the Pennsylvania State Police:</b></p>\n<p>State Trooper Joel D. Follmer\u2019s determined efforts and innovative policing techniques on an 18-month series of kidnapping and rape investigations throughout Pennsylvania led to the arrest of a serial rapist with assaults dating back as far as 1994. Trooper Follmer arrested the suspect in December of last year, who immediately confessed to several cases, and provided information on many others that he had attempted in the past and was planning in the future. The suspect is currently awaiting trial.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b><u>FIELD OPERATIONS</u></b></p>\n<p><b>Sergeant Girard Tell III and Sergeant Ryan VanSyckle of the Pleasantville Police Department, New Jersey: </b></p>\n<p>Since 2016, Sergeants Tell and VanSyckle have consistently led the department in arrests and drug seizures by their dogged persistence to seek out and dismantle criminal street gangs, including a regional investigation, which netted more than 100 felony indictments against the South Side Mob street gang. Their tireless drive to remove the most dangerous and violent offenders has had a significant impact on the criminal operating environment within the community, including a steady downward trend of gun violence and a 55 percent decrease in confirmed shooting calls for service.</p>\n<p><b>Corporal Richard White III of the Ohio County Sheriff\u2019s Office, West Virginia: </b></p>\n<p>In June 2017, dispatchers notified law enforcement and fire department agencies regarding several people who had flipped over their boats while kayaking and got caught in the swift current in Wheeling Creek. Corporal White arrived on the scene and waded into the heavy current, rescuing two females caught in the downstream. Corporal White was instrumental in preventing a possible tragic incident while putting himself in harm\u2019s way. About a year earlier, a little boy had died after falling into the creek. Corporal White\u2019s quick and selfless action helped ensure that those circumstances were not repeated.</p>\n<p><b>Deputy Ned Nemeth of the Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Nevada:</b></p>\n<p>Deputy Nemeth has demonstrated active exceptional performance in field operations. As a full time K-9 handler, he works highway interdiction and has successfully reduced illegal operations in the past year along the I-80 corridor, including seizing 206 pounds of illegal marijuana, 359.42 grams of methamphetamine, and 43 contraband prescription opioid pain pills. Deputy Nemeth is known for providing high quality information about his interstate contacts to other agencies across the country. His efforts as a part of the HIDTA task force in northern Nevada not only have positive effects on his own community but also make meaningful contributions to other jurisdictions working to disrupt and dismantle organized drug trafficking operations nationwide.</p>\n<p><b>Detective Thomas Curley of the Wilmington Police Department, Delaware: </b></p>\n<p>Over the past 14 years, Wilmington Detective Thomas Curley has provided outstanding efforts in conducting criminal investigations to protect the people of Wilmington from gangs and violent crime, including the first successful illegal gang prosecution in the State of Delaware, which was later upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court. He possesses the ability to seek out and successfully talk with witnesses to develop leads and works tirelessly coordinating complex investigations. Detective Curley is dedicated to his job and strives for justice for the victims of violent crimes.</p>\n<p><b>Officers Jeremiah Beason, Patrick Burke, Monty Fetherston, and Steve Morris, Jr., of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Nevada:</b></p>\n<p>On October 2017, at approximately 10:05 p.m., a lone gunman fired into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers attending a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 innocent people and injuring more than 850. Las Vegas Metropolitan Officers Beason, Burke, Fetherston, and Morris were the first four first responders to react during this active shooter situation. These four officers rescued injured civilians, cleared the surrounding rooms near the shooter, and secured the perimeter.\u00a0 By running towards the danger, they saved countless lives.</p>\n<p><b>Officers Jose Arriaga, Ruben Avalos, Carlos Escobar, Randy Jreisat, Arthur Meza, Ashley Mitchell, David Nick, Jr., Adrian Nu\u00f1ez, Christina Salas, and Solly Samara of the Los Angeles Police Department, California: </b></p>\n<p>In September 2017, the Los Angeles Police Department created the MacArthur Park Task Force to conduct uniform patrol in and around MacArthur Park and other surrounding areas. This team worked to restore order to the community around MacArthur Park by applying constant law enforcement and community involvement to the area to combat all crime and quality of life issues. These ten officers made 1,125 arrests in 32 weeks, issued 980 citations and offered services to hundreds of individuals. Their work is directly responsible for a 40 percent reduction of Part 1 crimes and a 46 percent reduction of violent crimes in the zone. These 10 officers helped transform this park and its surrounding neighborhood from its former blight, turning it into a clean, beautiful park.</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald of the District of Minnesota and Special Agent in Charge Jill Sanborn of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Peteris Sahurovs aka \u201cPiotrek\u201d and \u201cSagade,\u201d 29, was sentenced to 33 months in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\u00a0 District Judge Ann D. Montgomery of the District of Minnesota imposed the sentence.\u00a0 Sahurovs will be removed from the United States to Latvia following his prison sentence.\u00a0 Sahurovs was arrested on a District of Minnesota indictment in Latvia in June 2011, but was released by a Latvian court and later fled. \u00a0In November 2016, Sahurovs was located in Poland and apprehended by Polish law enforcement and extradited to the United States in June 2017. Sahurovs was at one time the FBI\u2019s fifth most wanted cybercriminal and a reward of up to $50,000 had been offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction.\u00a0 He pleaded guilty before Judge Montgomery on Feb. 7.</p>\n<p>According to admissions made in connection with his plea, from at least May 2009 to June 2011, Sahurovs operated a \u201cbullet-proof\u201d web hosting service in Latvia, through which he leased server space to customers seeking to carry out criminal schemes without being identified or taken offline.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that he knew his customers were using his servers to perpetrate criminal schemes, including the transmission of malware, fake anti-virus software, spam, and botnets to unwitting victims, and he received notices from Internet governance entities (such as Spamhaus) that his servers were hosting malicious activity.\u00a0 Nonetheless, Sahurovs admitted he took steps to protect the criminal schemes from being discovered or disrupted, and hosted them on his servers for financial gain.</p>\n<p>Sahurovs admitted that from in or about February 2010 to in or about September 2010, he registered domain names, provided bullet-proof hosting services, and gave technical support to a \u201cscareware\u201d scheme targeting visitors to the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i>\u2019s website.\u00a0 On Feb. 19, 2010, the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> began hosting an online advertisement, purporting to be for Best Western hotels, on its website, startribune.com.\u00a0 Two days later, however, the advertisement began causing the computers of visitors to the website to be infected with malware.\u00a0 This malware, also known as \u201cscareware,\u201d caused visitors to experience slow system performance, unwanted pop-ups and total system failure.\u00a0 Website visitors also received a fake \u201cWindows Security Alert\u201d pop-up informing them that their computer had been infected with a virus and another pop-up that falsely represented that they needed to purchase the \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d computer program to fix their security issues, at a price of $49.95.</p>\n<p>Website visitors who clicked the \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d window were presented with an online order form to purchase a purported security program called \u201cAntivirus Soft.\u201d\u00a0 Users who purchased \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d would receive a file download that \u201cunfroze\u201d their computers and stopped the pop-ups and security notifications.\u00a0 However, the defendant admitted, the file was not a real anti-virus product and did not perform legitimate computer security functions, and merely caused malware that members of the conspiracy had previously installed to cease operating.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the defendant admitted, victim users who did not choose to purchase \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d became immediately inundated with so many pop-ups containing fraudulent \u201csecurity alerts\u201d that all information, data, and files on their computers were rendered inaccessible.\u00a0 Members of the conspiracy defrauded victims out of substantial amounts of money as a result of the scheme.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that as a result of his participation, he made between $150,000 and $250,000 U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office. \u00a0The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs secured the extradition from Poland and the Polish National Police, the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the Ministry of Justice provided substantial assistance in this matter. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy C. Rank of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney Aaron R. Cooper of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section prosecuted the case.</p></div>",

Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Greenberg for the Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBI Washington Field Office\u2019s Criminal Division made the announcement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Raymond Odigie Uadiale, 41, of Maple Valley, Washington, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge William P. Dimitrouleas for the Southern District of Florida following his June 4 guilty plea.\u00a0 The indictment charged Uadiale with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of substantive money laundering.\u00a0 As part of the plea agreement, the government dismissed the substantive count.\u00a0 In addition to his prison sentence, Uadiale was also sentenced to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>According to the factual proffer filed in connection with the plea agreement, Uadiale helped to \u201ccash out\u201d the payments of victims whose computers were infected with Reveton, a type of ransomware that displayed a splash screen on the victim\u2019s computer with the logo of a law enforcement organization.\u00a0 The splash screen would include a message falsely telling the victim that the law enforcement organization had found illegal material on the infected computer and required the payment of a \u201cfine\u201d to regain access to the computer and its data.\u00a0 The ransomware directed the victim to purchase a GreenDot MoneyPak and enter the account number into a form on the splash screen.\u00a0 Using prepaid debit cards, Uadiale transformed the MoneyPak funds into cash, kept a portion for himself, and sent a portion back to Reveton\u2019s distributor, who resided in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy cashing out and then laundering victim payments, Raymond Uadiale played an essential role in an international criminal operation that victimized unsuspecting Americans by infecting their computers with malicious ransomware,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThis conviction and sentence is another demonstration of the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to prosecuting cybercriminals and shutting down the networks they use to launder their criminal proceeds.\u00a0 We are grateful for the outstanding collaboration of our U.S. and international law enforcement partners in this successful investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis was a sophisticated scheme to conceal the proceeds of a particularly insidious type of ransomware,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Greenberg.\u00a0 \u201cBy claiming to originate from law enforcement agencies, Reveton not only victimized computer users, it also exploited the agencies in whose names the ransomware claimed to be acting.\u00a0 Today\u2019s sentence demonstrates that those who seek to profit from the spread of such malicious software face serious consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to court documents, Uadiale used the digital currency platform Liberty Reserve to transfer approximately 70 percent of the ransomware proceeds back to the ransomware distributor.\u00a0 Between October 2012 and March 27, 2013, while he was a graduate student at Florida International University, Uadiale sent approximately $93,640 in Liberty Reserve dollars to his co-conspirator as part of their scheme.\u00a0 Public records show that Uadiale was hired by Microsoft as a network engineer after the conspiracy charged in the indictment ended.</p>\n<p>The case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the U.K.\u2019s National Crime Agency, and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared M.

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of Connecticut.</p>\n<p>According to evidence admitted at trial, Jared Dylan Sparks, 35, of Ardmore, Oklahoma, an electrical engineer, worked at LBI Inc., a defense contractor that has designed and built unmanned underwater vehicles for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Office of Naval Research and deployable ice buoys used to gather weather data for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\u00a0 During the course of his employment with LBI, Sparks collaborated with Charles River Analytics (CRA), a Massachusetts-based software company that developed software to be integrated into LBI\u2019s unmanned underwater vehicles.\u00a0 In late 2011, CRA sought to expand into the hardware business and eventually agreed with the Office of Naval Research that it would complete the testing for a number of the unmanned vehicles designed and developed by LBI.\u00a0 Sometime after April 2011, Sparks began exploring employment with CRA, and was eventually hired by that company in January 2012.\u00a0 Before he left LBI, however, Sparks surreptitiously uploaded thousands of LBI files to his personal account with Dropbox, a cloud-based file-storage application.\u00a0 Those files included LBI\u2019s accounting and engineering files as well as photographs related to designs and renderings used to fabricate and manufacture LBI\u2019s unmanned underwater vehicles and buoys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Nov. 3, 2016, a grand jury returned a 29-count indictment charging Sparks and Jay Williams of Griswold, Connecticut, with various offenses stemming from this alleged scheme.</p>\n<p>The jury found Sparks guilty of six counts of theft of trade secrets, six counts of upload of trade secrets, and one count of transmission of trade secrets.\u00a0 Each of these offenses carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. The jury found Sparks not guilty of multiple counts of the indictment, and Williams not guilty of all the counts in which he was charged. Sparks\u2019 sentencing has not yet been scheduled.</p>\n<p>\u201cJared Sparks stole thousands of documents\u2014including proprietary designs and renderings\u2014from his former employer when he left to work for a competitor,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan.\u00a0 \u201cYesterday\u2019s verdict sends a clear message that the Department of Justice is committed to protecting American intellectual property and will aggressively prosecute those who steal it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn order to protect both our country\u2019s national security and the intellectual property of Connecticut\u2019s defense contractors, our office is committed to prosecuting those who steal trade secrets and hope to profit from the theft,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Durham.</p>\n<p>\u201cTheft of trade secrets from a Defense contractor harms the U.S. taxpayer and threatens the integrity of the Defense Department's procurement system,\u201d said Special Agent-in-Charge Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cDCIS is committed to working with the DOJ, FBI and other law enforcement partners, to investigate and prosecute those individuals who seek to profit at the expense of our national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Intellectual property theft cost U.S. businesses billions in revenue annually and robs the nation of jobs and taxes,\" said FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Fuller. \"Preventing intellectual property theft is a priority of the FBI's criminal investigative program. The key to this successful prosecution was due to linking considerable resources and collaboration of the private sector, federal law enforcement partners, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.\"</p>\n<p>This matter was investigated by DCIS and the FBI with assistance from the Department of Defense\u2019s Computer Forensic Laboratory.\u00a0 The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss of the District of Connecticut and Trial Attorneys Kebharu Smith and Joss Nichols of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), with assistance from the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab.\u00a0</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Vincent Ramos, the chief executive of Canada-based Phantom Secure, and four of his associates were indicted by a federal grand jury today on charges that they knowingly and intentionally participated in a criminal enterprise that facilitated the transnational importation and distribution of narcotics through the sale and service of encrypted communications.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first time the U.S. government has targeted a company and its principals for knowingly and intentionally conspiring with criminal organizations by providing them with the technological tools to evade law enforcement and obstruct justice while committing transnational drug trafficking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cWith one American dying of a drug overdose every nine minutes, our great nation is suffering the deadliest drug epidemic in our history,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cIncredibly, some have sought to profit off of this crisis, including by specifically taking advantage of encryption technologies to further criminal activity, and to obstruct, impede, and evade law enforcement, as this case illustrates.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute not just drug traffickers, but those who help them spread addiction and death in our communities. I want to thank the FBI, DEA, Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security Investigations, Washington State Police, the Bellingham and Blaine Police Departments, and all of our law enforcement partners around the world, including Australia, Canada, Panama, Hong Kong, and Thailand for their hard work on this case. Today's indictment sends a clear message that drug traffickers and criminals cannot hide, because we will hunt them down and find them wherever they are.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cWhen criminals go dark, and law enforcement cannot monitor their phones or access evidence, crimes cannot be solved, criminals cannot be stopped and lives can be lost,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman. \u201cAs a result of this groundbreaking prosecution,\u00a0we will disable\u00a0the communication infrastructure provided by a criminal enterprise to drug traffickers and other violent criminals. Phantom Secure was designed to profit off of criminal activity committed by transnational criminal organizations around the world. We are committed to shutting these criminals down.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe indictment of Vincent Ramos and his associates is a milestone against transnational crime,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\u00a0 \u201cPhantom Secure allegedly provided a service designed to allow criminals the world over to evade law enforcement\u00a0to traffic drugs and commit acts of violent crime without detection. Ramos and his company made millions off this criminal activity, and our takedown sends a serious message to those who exploit encryption to go dark on law enforcement. I want to thank our partners at the Department of Justice, as well as our Australian and Canadian law enforcement partners, for their incredible work on this case.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nRamos was taken into custody in Bellingham, Washington, on March 7.\u00a0 Ramos made his first appearance in the Western District of Washington and will face charges in San Diego. The remaining four defendants are fugitives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to court documents, Phantom Secure advertised its products as impervious to decryption, wiretapping or legal third-party records requests. Phantom Secure also guaranteed the destruction of evidence contained within a device if it was compromised, either by an informant or because it fell into the hands of law enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe indictment alleges that as a result of its efforts to facilitate international crime, Phantom Secure has generated approximately $80 million in annual revenue since 2008 and facilitated drug trafficking, obstruction of justice, and violent crime around the world.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe international operation to arrest the company\u2019s chief executive and seize Phantom Secure\u2019s infrastructure involved cooperation and efforts by law enforcement authorities in the United States, Australia, Canada, with additional assistance from U.S. and foreign law enforcement in Panama, Hong Kong, and Thailand.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past two weeks, in cooperation with Australian Federal Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, more than 250 agents around the globe conducted approximately 25 searches of houses and offices of Phantom\u00a0Secure\u00a0associates in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, and in Australia and Canada, seizing Phantom Secure devices, assets, and evidence of the charged crimes.\u00a0 The coordinated effort led to the seizure of servers, computers, cell phones, and Phantom\u00a0Secure\u00a0devices used to operate the Phantom Secure network, as well as drugs and weapons.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRamos and the others - Kim Augustus Rodd, Younes Nasri, Michael Gamboa and Christopher Poquiz - are charged with participating in and aiding and abetting a racketeering enterprise and conspiring to import and distribute controlled substances around the world. The defendants have been charged with Conspiracy to Commit RICO in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01962 and Conspiracy to Aid and Abet the Distribution of Controlled Substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.\u00a0 \u00a7\u00a0841 and 846.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthorities have seized Phantom Secure\u2019s property, including more than 150 domains and licenses which were being used by transnational criminal organizations to send and receive encrypted messages. Authorities also seized bank accounts and property in Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis case stems from an investigation in the Southern District of California of a Phantom Secure client who used Phantom devices to coordinate shipments of thousands of kilograms of cocaine and other drugs throughout the globe.\u00a0 According to court documents, there were an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Phantom devices in use worldwide before the authorities dismantled the company. This coordinated action means Phantom Secure\u2019s clients can no longer use these devices to commit crimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Timothy O\u2019Connor, Executive Director of the Criminal Investigations Division New South Wales Crime Commission, \u201cThe disruption of the Phantom Secure platform has been one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Australia.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to our foreign law enforcement partners, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office further recognizes the support and assistance of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration; Customs and Border Protection; the Department of Homeland Security; Seattle and Las Vegas field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Washington State Police Department; the City of Bellingham, Washington Police Department; the City of Blaine, Washington Police Department; and the Canada Border Services Agency, among others, without whose help this prosecution could not have been possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking on behalf of Australian law enforcement authorities, Australian Federal Police (AFP) Assistant Commissioner Organised Crime, Neil Gaughan said today Australia\u2019s role in this complex and unique investigation began in early 2017 following an exchange of intelligence with the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, Australian authorities executed 19 search warrants across four states last week as part of the international action, where more than 1,000 encrypted mobile devices were seized.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe action taken in the U.S. directly impacts the upper echelons of organized crime both here in Australia and offshore, who until now have been able to confidently control and direct illicit activity like drug importations, money laundering and associated serious criminal offending,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner Gaughan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cOur thanks go to our international partners \u2013 the FBI and RCMP \u2013 who have been outstanding in working methodically around the clock together with us on this unique investigation. Without their cooperation, commitment and shared singular drive, Australian law enforcement agencies would not be announcing this significant result today.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAustralian agencies involved in this investigation include the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the New South Wales Crime Commission, state police from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, the Australian Tax Office and financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThis investigation is a prime example of law enforcement agencies from around the world working together to identify, investigate and charge people involved in transnational criminal activity,\u201d says Assistant Commissioner Jim Gresham, RCMP Criminal Operations Officer, Investigative Services and Organized Crime. \u201cWe remain committed to investigating and disrupting these illegal activities that adversely affect each of our communities.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThis case is the result of ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a partnership that brings together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The principal mission of the OCDETF program is to identify, disrupt, dismantle and prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and money laundering organizations and enterprises.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charges and allegations contained in an indictment or complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><u>DEFENDANTS</u>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\nVincent Ramos (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Richmond, British Columbia Canada<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cCEO\u201d<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cBusiness\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nKim Augustus Rodd (2)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Phuket, Thailand<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka Visith Vongthai<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cSnowstar\u201d<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cGlobal\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nYounes Nasri (3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dubai, United Arab Emirates<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cMaestro\u201d<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cJesse\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Gamboa (4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Los Angeles, CA<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cChino\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher Poquiz (5) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Los Angeles, CA<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cCaddy\u201d<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0aka \u201cCad\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><u>SUMMARY OF CHARGES</u></b><br/>\n<br/>\nRacketeering Conspiracy to Conduct Enterprise Affairs (RICO Conspiracy), in violation of 18 USC \u00a71962(d)<br/>\nMaximum Penalty: Life in prison<br/>\n<br/>\nConspiracy to Aid and Abet the Distribution of Narcotics, in violation of 21 USC\u00a0\u00a7841 and 846; Title 18 USC \u00a72<br/>\nMaximum Penalty: Life in prison<br/>\n\u00a0</p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>The Department of Justice today announced the indictment of Michael Ron David Kadar, 19, who holds dual United States and Israeli citizenship, in three jurisdictions for hate crimes and other offenses.</p>\n<p>The indictment from Florida charges Kadar with hate crimes as a result of threatening calls he made to Jewish Community Centers in the state. In addition, the indictment from the District of Columbia charges Kadar with threatening the Israeli Embassy and the Anti-Defamation League in Washington, D.C. The third indictment charges Kadar with cyberstalking and conveying false information to police dispatch regarding harm to private residents in Georgia.</p>\n<p>An investigation into numerous threats made to individuals and organizations throughout the United States in 2016 and early 2017 led to Kadar being <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/usisraeli-man-charged-connection-threats-jewish-community-centers-conveying-false-information\">charged</a> initially in criminal complaints on April 21, 2017 in Florida and Georgia following his arrest in Israel. Kadar remains in custody in Israel where he also faces charges.</p>\n<p>The indictment from the Middle District of Florida charges that beginning on or about Jan. 4, 2017, and continuing until Feb. 27, 2017, Kadar made multiple threatening calls involving bomb threats and active shooter threats to numerous Jewish Community Centers throughout Florida. Additionally, the indictment charges Kadar with attempting to obstruct the free exercise of religion at the Jewish Community Centers when he made the bomb threats and active shooter threats. Finally, the indictment charges that Kadar made bomb threats to the Orlando International Airport and a middle school in the Middle District of Florida. Although no actual explosives were found, many of the calls resulted in the temporary closure and evacuation or lockdown of the targeted facilities, and required law enforcement and emergency personnel to respond to and clear the area. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment from the District of Columbia charges that on or about March 7, 2017, Kadar made a threatening call to the Anti-Defamation League involving a bomb threat. Additionally, the indictment alleges that on or about March 9, 2017, Kadar sent a threatening email to the Israeli Embassy involving a bomb threat.</p>\n<p>The indictment from the Middle District of Georgia charges that on or about Jan. 3, 2017, Kadar made a phone call to a police department conveying false information about an alleged hostage situation in progress at a private residence in Athens, Georgia, which included a threat to kill responding police officers. Police and emergency personnel responded to the scene, only to learn that there was no emergency.</p>\n<p>The hate crime charges each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, the bomb threats charges each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, and the interstate threats charge, the hoax charge, and the cyberstalking charge each carry a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. If convicted, Kadar could also be subject to court ordered restitution.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen individuals target victims of their crimes based on who they are, what they believe, or how they worship, they target the bedrock principles on which our nation was founded,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cThese alleged threats of violence instilled fear in the Jewish community and other communities across the country, and it is the Justice Department\u2019s duty to make sure all Americans can live their lives without this type of fear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese alleged threats were very real for those individuals who were evacuated, for the first responders who quickly mobilized to get people out of harm\u2019s way, and for those in Jewish communities across the United States who felt targeted and unsafe,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThis indictment demonstrates the FBI\u2019s commitment to working together with our partners to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans, and shows that we will not stand by as someone threatens our communities based on their religion or their beliefs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThreats, intimidation, or violence perpetrated against anyone because of their beliefs, their faith, or how they choose to worship is intolerable,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez for the Middle District of Florida. \u201cIndividuals should be free to exercise these rights without fear. We will continue to use our resources to enforce these precious rights for all individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe indictment returned today in the District of Columbia is part of a broader nationwide fight against hate, terror, and threats in all of their forms,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu for the District of Columbia.\u00a0\u201cThe charges also reflect the tireless dedication of the DOJ, the FBI, and our local and international partners to rooting out and prosecuting those who would terrorize our communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHiding behind anonymous phone calls to threaten innocent citizens is cowardly and dangerous,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Charles E. Peeler for the Middle District of Georgia.\u00a0\u201cThe calls that this defendant allegedly made harassed innocent victims, endangered first responders and the victims themselves, and needlessly consumed law enforcement resources vital to protecting our communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the FBI Tampa Division, FBI Washington Field Office, and FBI Atlanta Division; the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida; the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia; U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Georgia; the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; and the Criminal Section of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this case. Federal authorities also acknowledge and appreciate the assistance and the investigative efforts of the Israeli National Police.</p>\n<p>An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence of guilt. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p></div>",

The indictment charges thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian companies for committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system, including the 2016 Presidential election. The defendants allegedly conducted what they called \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d with the stated goal of \u201cspread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThis indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. \u201cThe indictment alleges that the Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy.\u00a0We must not allow them to succeed. The Department of Justice will continue to work cooperatively with other law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and with the Congress, to defend our nation against similar current and future schemes. I want to thank the federal agents and prosecutors working on this case for their exceptional service. And we received exceptional cooperation from private sector companies like Facebook, Oath, PayPal, and Twitter.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment, twelve of the individual defendants worked at various times for Internet Research Agency LLC, a Russian company based in St. Petersburg, Russia. The other individual defendant, Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, funded the conspiracy through companies known as Concord Management and Consulting LLC, Concord Catering, and many subsidiaries and affiliates. The conspiracy was part of a larger operation called \u201cProject Lakhta.\u201d Project Lakhta included multiple components, some involving domestic audiences within the Russian Federation and others targeting foreign audiences in multiple countries.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nInternet Research Agency allegedly operated through Russian shell companies. It employed hundreds of persons for its online operations, ranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support, with an annual budget of millions of dollars. Internet Research Agency was a structured organization headed by a management group and arranged in departments, including graphics, search-engine optimization, information technology, and finance departments. In 2014, the agency established a \u201ctranslator project\u201d to focus on the U.S. population. In July 2016, more than 80 employees were assigned to the translator project.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of the defendants allegedly traveled to the United States in 2014 to collect intelligence for their American political influence operations.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo hide the Russian origin of their activities, the defendants allegedly purchased space on computer servers located within the United States in order to set up a virtual private network.\u00a0The defendants allegedly used that infrastructure to establish hundreds of accounts on social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, making it appear that the accounts were controlled by persons within the United States.\u00a0They used stolen or fictitious American identities, fraudulent bank accounts, and false identification documents. The defendants posed as politically and socially active Americans, advocating for and against particular political candidates. They established social media pages and groups to communicate with unwitting Americans. They also purchased political advertisements on social media.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Russians also recruited and paid real Americans to engage in political activities, promote political campaigns, and stage political rallies. The defendants and their co-conspirators pretended to be grassroots activists. According to the indictment, the Americans did not know that they were communicating with Russians.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the election, the defendants allegedly staged rallies to support the President-elect while simultaneously staging rallies to protest his election. For example, the defendants organized one rally to support the President-elect and another rally to oppose him\u2014both in New York, on the same day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn September 13, 2017, soon after the news media reported that the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was investigating evidence that Russian operatives had used social media to interfere in the 2016 election, one defendant allegedly wrote, \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity.... So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with my colleagues.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThe indictment includes eight criminal counts. Count One alleges a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, by all of the defendants. The defendants allegedly conspired to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of State in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCount Two charges conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud by Internet Research Agency and two individual defendants.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounts Three through Eight charge aggravated identity theft by Internet Research Agency and four individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone charged with a crime is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court. At trial, prosecutors must introduce credible evidence that is sufficient to prove each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, to the unanimous satisfaction of a jury of twelve citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Special Counsel's investigation is ongoing. There will be no comments from the Special Counsel at this time.</p></div>",

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, First Assistant U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick of the District of New Jersey and Director Randolph D. Alles of the U.S. Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Vladimir Drinkman, 37, of Syktyvkar and Moscow, Russia, was sentenced to 144 months in prison. \u00a0Drinkman previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Jerome B. Simandle of the District of New Jersey to one count of conspiracy to commit unauthorized access of protected computers and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a manner affecting a financial institution. \u00a0Dmitriy Smilianets, 34, of Moscow, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a manner affecting a financial institution and was sentenced to 51 months and 21 days in prison. \u00a0Both men pleaded guilty in September 2015 before Judge Simandle, who imposed the sentences yesterday in Camden, New Jersey federal court. \u00a0In addition to the prison terms, Judge Simandle sentenced Drinkman to three years of supervised release and Smilianets to five years of supervised release.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drinkman and Smilianets were arrested in the Netherlands on June 28, 2012. Drinkman was extradited to the District of New Jersey on Feb. 17, 2015, and Smilianets was extradited on Sept. 7, 2012.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrinkman and Smilianets not only stole over 160 million credit card numbers from credit card processors, banks, retailers, and other corporate victims, they also used their bounty to fuel a robust underground market for hacked information,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \u201cWhile mega breaches like these continue to affect millions of individuals around the world, hackers and would-be hackers should know that the Department of Justice will use all available tools to identify, arrest, and prosecute anyone who attacks the networks on which businesses and their customers rely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants operated at the highest levels of illegal hacking and trafficking of stolen identities,\u201d First Assistant U.S. Attorney Fitzpatrick. \u201cThey used their sophisticated computer skills to infiltrate computer networks, steal information and sell it for a profit. Perpetrators of some of the largest data breaches in history, these defendants posed a real threat to our economy, privacy and national security, and cannot be tolerated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case demonstrates the investigative capabilities of the U.S. Secret Service and the collaborative efforts of our law enforcement partners, specifically the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice,\u201d Special Agent in Charge McKevitt said. \u00a0\u201cThe Secret Service will continue to develop innovative ways to protect the financial infrastructure of the United States and bring to justice cyber criminals who use emerging technologies to conduct business.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drinkman and Smilianets admitted to their roles in a conspiracy with three co-defendants to hack into the networks of corporate victims engaged in financial transactions, retailers that received and transmitted financial data and other institutions with information that the conspirators could exploit for profit, including the computer networks of NASDAQ, 7-Eleven, Carrefour, JCP, Hannaford, Heartland, Wet Seal, Commidea, Dexia, JetBlue, Dow Jones, Euronet, Visa Jordan, Global Payment, Diners Singapore and Ingenicard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment in this case and statements made in court, the five defendants each played specific roles in the scheme. \u00a0Drinkman and Alexandr Kalinin, 31, of St. Petersburg, Russia, allegedly specialized in penetrating network security and gaining access to the corporate victims\u2019 systems. Drinkman and Roman Kotov, 36, of Moscow, allegedly specialized in mining the networks to steal valuable data. The hackers hid their activities using anonymous web-hosting services allegedly provided by Mikhail Rytikov, 30, of Odessa, Ukraine. \u00a0Smilianets sold the information stolen by the other conspirators and distributed the proceeds of the scheme to the participants.</p>\n<p>Drinkman and Kalinin were previously charged in New Jersey as \u201cHacker 2\u201d and \u201cHacker 1\u201d in a 2009 indictment charging Albert Gonzalez, 34, of Miami, Florida, in connection with five corporate data breaches \u2013 including the breach of Heartland Payment Systems Inc., which at the time was the largest ever reported. Gonzalez is currently serving 20 years in federal prison for those offenses. Kalinin is also charged in two federal indictments in the Southern District of New York: the first charges Kalinin in connection with hacking certain computer servers used by NASDAQ and the second charges him and another Russian hacker, Nikolay Nasenkov, with an international scheme to steal bank account information from U.S.-based financial institutions. Rytikov was previously charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with an unrelated scheme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kalinin, Kotov and Rytikov remain at large.\u00a0</p>\n<p><u><strong>The Attacks</strong></u></p>\n<p>According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court, the five defendants allegedly penetrated the computer networks of corporate victims and stole user names and passwords, means of identification, credit and debit card numbers and other corresponding personal identification information of cardholders, acquiring more than 160 million card numbers through hacking.</p>\n<p>The initial entry was often gained using a \u201cSQL injection attack.\u201d SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a type of programing language designed to manage data held in particular types of databases; the hackers allegedly identified vulnerabilities in SQL databases and used those vulnerabilities to infiltrate a computer network. Once the network was infiltrated, the defendants allegedly placed malicious code, or malware, in the system. \u00a0This malware created a \u201cback door,\u201d leaving the system vulnerable and helping the defendants maintain access to the network. \u00a0In some cases, the defendants lost access to the system due to companies\u2019 security efforts, but were allegedly able to regain access through persistent attacks. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Instant message chats obtained by law enforcement revealed the defendants allegedly often targeted the victim companies for many months, waiting patiently as their efforts to bypass security were underway. \u00a0The defendants had malware implanted in multiple companies\u2019 servers for more than a year.\u00a0<br/>\nThe defendants allegedly used their access to the networks to install \u201csniffers,\u201d which were programs designed to identify, collect and steal data from the victims\u2019 computer networks. The defendants then allegedly used an array of computers located around the world to store the stolen data and ultimately sell it to others.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Selling the Data</strong></u></p>\n<p>According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court, after acquiring the card numbers and associated data \u2013 which they referred to as \u201cdumps\u201d \u2013 the conspirators sold it to resellers around the world. The buyers then sold the dumps through online forums or directly to individuals and organizations. Smilianets was in charge of sales, selling the data only to trusted identity theft wholesalers. He charged approximately $10 for each stolen American credit card number and associated data, approximately $50 for each European credit card number and associated data and approximately $15 for each Canadian credit card number and associated data \u2013 offering discounted pricing to bulk and repeat customers. Ultimately, the end users encoded each dump onto the magnetic strip of a blank plastic card and cashed out the value of the dump by withdrawing money from ATMs or making purchases with the cards.\u00a0</p>\n<p><u><strong>Covering Their Tracks</strong></u></p>\n<p>According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court, the defendants allegedly used a number of methods to conceal the scheme. Unlike traditional Internet service providers, Rytikov allowed his clients to hack with the knowledge he would never keep records of their online activities or share information with law enforcement. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the course of the conspiracy, the defendants allegedly communicated through private and encrypted communications channels to avoid detection. Fearing law enforcement would intercept even those communications, some of the conspirators attempted to meet in person.</p>\n<p>To protect against detection by the victim companies, the defendants allegedly altered the settings on victim company networks to disable security mechanisms from logging their actions. The defendants also worked to evade existing protections by security software.</p>\n<p>As a result of the scheme, financial institutions, credit card companies and consumers suffered hundreds of millions in losses \u2013 including more than $300 million in losses reported by just three of the corporate victims \u2013 and immeasurable losses to the identity theft victims in costs associated with stolen identities and false charges. The charges and allegations contained in indictments against the remaining defendants are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The case was investigated by special agents of the U.S. Secret Service, Newark Field Office and Criminal Investigative Division. The case is being prosecuted by by Trial Attorneys Andrew S. Pak and Richard Green and Deputy Chief of Litigation James Silver of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Herring of the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Section of the Economic Crimes Unit and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs. \u00a0The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in this case.</p>\n<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan and U.S. Attorney Carpenito thanked public prosecutors with the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice and the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Dutch National Police. \u00a0They also credited the special agents of the U.S. Secret Service, Newark Field Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Mark McKevitt, and the Criminal Investigative Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael D\u2019Ambrosio, for the ongoing investigation leading to yesterday\u2019s sentencings.</p></div>",

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Dayle Elieson of the District of Nevada, and Acting Executive Associate Director Derek N. Benner of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) made the announcement.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s indictment and arrests mark one of the largest cyberfraud enterprise prosecutions ever undertaken by the Department of Justice,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan.\u00a0 \u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Infraud operated like a business to facilitate cyberfraud on a global scale.\u00a0 Its members allegedly caused more than $530 million in actual losses to consumers, businesses, and financial institutions alike\u2014and it is alleged that the losses they intended to cause amounted to more than $2.2 billion.\u00a0 The Department of Justice refuses to allow these cybercriminals to use the perceived anonymity of the Internet as a shield for their crimes.\u00a0 We are committed to working closely with our international counterparts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes, wherever in the world they operate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is steadfastly committed to protecting America\u2019s national and economic security,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Elieson. \u201cCriminals cannot hide behind their computer screens. We are working vigilantly with American and international law enforcement partners to identify and disrupt transnational cybercrime organizations, such as the Infraud Organization.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCriminal cyber organizations like Infraud threaten not just U.S. citizens but people in every corner of the globe,\u201d said HSI Acting Executive Associate Director Benner. \u201cThe actions of computer hackers and identity thieves not only harm countless innocent Americans, but the threat they pose to our financial system and global commerce cannot be overstated.\u00a0 The criminals involved in such schemes may think they can escape detection by hiding behind their computer screens here and overseas, but as this case shows, cyberspace is not a refuge from justice.\u00a0 HSI will continue working with our law enforcement partners in this country and around the world to aggressively target cyber thieves to ensure the perpetrators face the full weight of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, the Infraud Organization was created in October 2010 by Svyatoslav Bondarenko aka \u201cObnon,\u201d aka \u201cRector,\u201d aka \u201cHelkern,\u201d 34, of Ukraine, to promote and grow interest in the Infraud Organization as the premier destination for carding\u2014purchasing retail items with counterfeit or stolen credit card information\u2014on the Internet. \u00a0Under the slogan, \u201cIn Fraud We Trust,\u201d the organization directed traffic and potential purchasers to the automated vending sites of its members, which served as online conduits to traffic in stolen means of identification, stolen financial and banking information, malware, and other illicit goods.\u00a0 It also provided an escrow service to facilitate illicit digital currency transactions among its members and employed screening protocols that purported to ensure only high quality vendors of stolen cards, personally identifiable information, and other contraband were permitted to advertise to members.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Infraud members held defined roles within the organization\u2019s hierarchy.\u00a0 \u201cAdministrators\u201d managed day-to-day operation of and strategic planning for the organization, approved and monitored membership, and meted out punishments and rewards to members.\u00a0 \u201cSuper Moderators\u201d oversaw and administered specific subject-matter areas within their expertise.\u00a0 \u201cModerators\u201d moderated one or two specific sub-forums within their areas of subject-matter expertise.\u00a0 \u201cVendors\u201d sold illicit products and services to Infraud members.\u00a0 Finally, \u201cVIP Members\u201d and \u201cMembers\u201d used the Infraud forum to gather information and to facilitate their criminal activities.\u00a0 As of March 2017, there were 10,901 registered members of the Infraud Organization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the course of its seven-year history, the Infraud Organization inflicted approximately $2.2 billion in intended losses, and more than $530 million in actual losses, on a wide swath of financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals, and would have continued to do so for the foreseeable future if left unchecked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The defendants indicted for their alleged roles in the Infraud

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Gregory G. Brooker of the District of Minnesota and Special Agent in Charge Richard T. Thornton of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Peteris Sahurovs aka Piotrek and Sagade, 28, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud before District Judge Ann D. Montgomery of the District of Minnesota.\u00a0 Sahurovs was arrested on a District of Minnesota indictment in Latvia in June of 2011, but was released by a Latvian court and later fled. \u00a0In November of 2016, Sahurovs was located in Poland and apprehended by Polish law enforcement and extradited to the United States in June 2017. Sahurovs was at one time the FBI\u2019s fifth most wanted cybercriminal and a reward of up to $50,000 had been offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction.\u00a0 He will be sentenced on June 6.</p>\n<p>According to admissions made in connection with his plea, from at least May 2009 to June 2011, Sahurovs operated a \u201cbullet-proof\u201d web hosting service in Latvia, through which he leased server space to customers seeking to carry out criminal schemes without being identified or taken offline.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that he knew his customers were using his servers to perpetrate criminal schemes, including the transmission of malware, fake anti-virus software, spam, and botnets to unwitting victims, and he received notices from Internet governance entities (such as Spamhaus) that his servers were hosting malicious activity.\u00a0 Nonetheless, Sahurovs admitted he took steps to protect the criminal schemes from being discovered or disrupted, and hosted them on his servers for financial gain.</p>\n<p>Sahurovs admitted that from in or about February 2010 to in or about September 2010, he registered domain names, provided bullet-proof hosting services, and gave technical support to a \u201cscareware\u201d scheme targeting visitors to the Minneapolis Star Tribune\u2019s website.\u00a0 On Feb. 19, 2010, the Minneapolis Star Tribune began hosting an online advertisement, purporting to be for Best Western hotels, on its website, startribune.com.\u00a0 Two days later, however, the advertisement began causing the computers of visitors to the website to be infected with malware.\u00a0 This malware, also known as \u201cscareware,\u201d caused visitors to experience slow system performance, unwanted pop-ups and total system failure.\u00a0 Website visitors also received a fake \u201cWindows Security Alert\u201d pop-up informing them that their computer had been infected with a virus and another pop-up that falsely represented that they needed to purchase the \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d computer program to fix their security issues, at a price of $49.95.</p>\n<p>Website visitors who clicked the \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d window were presented with an online order form to purchase a purported security program called \u201cAntivirus Soft.\u201d\u00a0 Users who purchased \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d would receive a file download that \u201cunfroze\u201d their computers and stopped the pop-ups and security notifications.\u00a0 However, the defendant admitted, the file was not a real anti-virus product and did not perform legitimate computer security functions, and merely caused malware that members of the conspiracy had previously installed to cease operating.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the defendant admitted, victim users who did not choose to purchase \u201cAntivirus Soft\u201d became immediately inundated with so many pop-ups containing fraudulent \u201csecurity alerts\u201d that all information, data, and files on their computers were rendered inaccessible.\u00a0 Members of the conspiracy defrauded victims out of substantial amounts of money as a result of the scheme.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that as a result of his participation, he made between $150,000 and $250,000 U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office. \u00a0The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, as well as the Polish National Police, the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the Ministry of Justice provided substantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy C. Rank of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney Aaron R. Cooper of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case. The Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in this matter.</p></div>",

Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of Connecticut and Special Agent in Charge Patricia M. Ferrick of the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Peter Yuryevich Levashov, 37, also known as Petr Levashov, Peter Severa, Petr Severa and Sergey Astakhov, of St. Petersburg, Russia, has been detained since April 7, 2017, in Spain when he was arrested by Spanish authorities based upon a criminal complaint and arrest warrant issued in the District of Connecticut.</p>\n<p>Levashov is scheduled to be arraigned today at approximately 6:00 p.m. before U.S. Magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p>\n<p>\u201cLevashov is alleged to have controlled and operated the Kelihos botnet which was used to distribute hundreds of millions of fraudulent e-mails per year, intercept credentials to online and financial accounts belonging to thousands of Americans, and spread ransomware throughout our networks,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s action, as well as the disruption of the Kelihos botnet in April 2017,\u00a0demonstrates the Department\u2019s steadfast commitment to working with our international law enforcement partners to\u00a0identify cybercriminals and hold them accountable for their conduct.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is alleged that, for years, Mr. Levashov profited handsomely by controlling a botnet that infected computers and affected computer users all over the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Durham.\u00a0 \u201cThanks to the excellent work of the FBI, with the assistance of our law enforcement partners in Spain, he was identified and apprehended, and will now face justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a result of a sophisticated and complex computer intrusion investigation, the FBI, working with national and international law enforcement partners, have now brought to justice an individual who, we allege, has been responsible for the theft of personal information and distribution of SPAM and malware through his operation of the Kelihos botnet,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Ferrick.</p>\n<p>As alleged in an eight count-indictment, a \u201cbotnet\u201d is a network of computers infected with a malicious software that allows a third party to control the entire computer network without the knowledge or consent of the computer owners. Levashov allegedly controlled and operated the Kelihos botnet to, among other things, harvest personal information and means of identification (including email addresses, usernames and logins, and passwords) from infected computers. To further the scheme, Levashov allegedly disseminated spam and distributed other malware \u2013 such as banking Trojans and ransomware, and advertised the Kelihos botnet spam and malware services to others for purchase in order to enrich himself.</p>\n<p>The indictment further alleges that during any 24-hour period, the Kelihos botnet was used to generate and distribute more than 2,500 unsolicited spam e-mails that advertised various criminal schemes, including deceptively promoting stocks in order to fraudulently increase their price (so-called \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d stock fraud schemes).</p>\n<p>On April 10, 2017, the Justice Department announced that it had taken action to dismantle the Kelihos botnet.</p>\n<p>On April 20, 2017, a grand jury in Bridgeport returned an indictment charging Levashov with one count of causing intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of conspiracy, one count of accessing protected computers in furtherance of fraud, one count of wire fraud, one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, two counts of fraud in connection with email and one count of aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>\n<p>This matter is assigned to U.S. District Judge Robert N. Chatigny in Hartford.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s New Haven Division and Anchorage Division are investigating the case, with the assistance from the Spanish National Police and the U.S. Marshals Service.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Vanessa Richards and David Huang of the District of Connecticut, with the assistance from Senior Trial Attorney Anthony Teelucksingh of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs handled the extradition in this matter. The U.S. Marshals Service assisted today\u2019s extradition.</p></div>",

Boente and<span> U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York made the announcement. </span>\u00a0The <span>sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas in White Plains, New York federal court.\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cXu, a Chinese national, is being held accountable for engaging in economic espionage against an American company,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. \u201cXu not only stole high tech trade secrets from his U.S. employer \u2013 a federal crime \u2013 he did so both for his own profit and intending to benefit the Chinese government.\u00a0 Xu\u2019s sentence clearly demonstrates that the National Security Division will not hesitate to pursue and prosecute those who steal from American businesses.\u00a0 I thank the many people who worked hard to bring this result.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cAs he previously admitted in federal court, Xu Jiaqiang stole high-tech trade secrets from a U.S. employer, intending to benefit the Chinese government,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Berman.\u00a0 \u201cThe laws governing economic espionage and trade secrets exist, in part, to protect the sanctity of American ingenuity and property.\u00a0 Xu\u2019s prison sentence should be a red flag for anyone attempting to illegally peddle American expertize and intellectual property to foreign bidders.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Superseding Indictment filed against Xu, as well as statements made in related court filings and proceedings:</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a particular U.S. company (the Victim Company).\u00a0 As a developer, Xu enjoyed access to certain proprietary software (the Proprietary Software), as well as that software\u2019s underlying source code (the Proprietary Source Code).\u00a0 The Proprietary Software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the Victim Company in the United States and other countries.\u00a0 A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers.\u00a0 The Victim Company takes significant precautions to protect the Proprietary Source Code as a trade secret.\u00a0 Among other things, the Proprietary Source Code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed only by a small subset of the Victim Company\u2019s employees.\u00a0 Before receiving Proprietary Source Code access, Victim Company employees must first request and receive approval from a particular Victim Company official.\u00a0 Victim Company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information.\u00a0 The Victim Company takes these and other precautions in part because the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code are economically valuable, which value depends in part on the Proprietary Source Code\u2019s secrecy.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the Victim Company.\u00a0 Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer (UC-1), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer (UC-2), who posed as a project manager, working for UC-1.\u00a0 In these communications, Xu discussed his past experience with the Victim Company and indicated that he had experience with the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code.\u00a0 On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 a code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu\u2019s prior work with the Victim Company.\u00a0 A Victim Company employee (Employee-1) later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary Victim Company material that related to the Proprietary Source Code.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that Xu was willing to consider providing UC-2\u2019s company with the Proprietary Source Code as a platform for UC-2\u2019s company to facilitate the development of its own data storage system.\u00a0 Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the Proprietary Software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu\u2019s specifications.\u00a0 Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the Xu Upload).\u00a0 Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload.\u00a0 In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code (Employee-2).\u00a0 Based on Employee-2\u2019s analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software.\u00a0 It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company\u2019s direction.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the Hotel).\u00a0 Xu stated, in sum and substance, that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that Xu knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which Xu had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (i.e., the Xu Upload).\u00a0 Xu also indicated that Xu knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that Xu had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company\u2019s property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company\u2019s authorization.\u00a0 Xu told UC-2 that Xu could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software\u2019s origins \u2013 i.e., that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code \u2013 including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel.\u00a0 During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what Xu represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on Xu\u2019s laptop.\u00a0 Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted.\u00a0 Xu also stated that Xu had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code\u2019s command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom Xu had previously provided the Proprietary Software using Xu\u2019s stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

FBI\u2019s outstanding investigative efforts.\u00a0 Mr. Berman also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee and Ilan Graff of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David

said U.S. Attorney Berman.\u00a0 \u201cToday we publicly announce charges against Ganczarski alleging that he participated in the planning of plots to kill Americans with high-level al Qaeda terrorists Khaled Shaikh Mohammad, Usama bin Laden and others. \u00a0The unsealing of the indictment exemplifies this Office\u2019s commitment to the relentless pursuit and prosecution of those who seek to harm Americans.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cAs alleged, Ganczarski willingly supported the goals of al Qaeda, immersing himself in social circles that included the likes of Usama bin Laden and one of the future hijackers in the September 11 attacks, among others,\u201d said Assistant Director Sweeney. \u00a0\u201cHe allegedly participated in efforts to kill Americans by providing technological support and guidance, and arranged meetings between senior officials in the organization and other like-minded individuals bent on future attacks against U.S. interests. \u00a0While he\u2019s spent the past fifteen years behind bars in France, we haven\u2019t forgotten his allegiance to those who have threatened our interests both at home and abroad. \u00a0We will continue to work with our international partners to mitigate the threat of global terrorism, bringing to justice everyone who participates in or materially supports this crime.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cAs alleged, Christian Ganczarski worked for al-Qaeda, lived in its camps and guest houses,\u201d said Police Commissioner O\u2019Neill. \u00a0\u201cHe rubbed shoulders with Osama Bin Laden and the men who planned and executed plots from the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 225 people, to the 9-11 attacks that cost 3000 lives, most of them here in New York City.\u00a0 Ganczarski allegedly provided al-Qaeda with expertise in logistics, computers, radio communications and the maintenance of weapons systems that would be used against Americans soldiers after the 9/11 attacks. \u00a0This case is another example of the work of the FBI agents and NYPD detectives of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \u00a0There is no time too long, or place to far, or suspect out of reach when it comes to bringing terrorists, or those who aid them to justice.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>As alleged in the Superseding Indictment unsealed in federal court:</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Al Qaeda is an international terrorist organization dedicated to opposing non-Islamic governments with force and violence.\u00a0 The organization was founded by Usama bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, aka Abu Hafs el Masri (Abu Hafs el Masri), and was headquartered in Afghanistan since approximately 1996.\u00a0 Bin Laden served as the leader or \u201cemir\u201d of al Qaeda until his death on or about May 2, 2011.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Al Qaeda has a command control structure that included a <i>majlis al shura </i>(or consultation council) that discussed and approved major undertakings, including terrorist operations.\u00a0 Bin Laden and Abu Hafs el Masri sat on the <i>majlis al shura</i> of al Qaeda, as did others, including Saif al Adel.\u00a0 Khaled Shaikh Mohammad, aka Mukhtar, devised, planned, and facilitated terrorist operations for al Qaeda, and he also assisted in the preparation of promotional media used by al Qaeda to advertise its terrorist agenda and attract recruits.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Ganczarski<span>, </span>a German citizen born in Poland, traveled from Germany to Pakistan and Afghanistan on at least five separate occasions between 1999 and 2001.\u00a0 During these trips, Ganczarski became associated with al Qaeda and developed personal relationships with bin Laden, Abu Hafs el Masri, al Adel and Mohammad.\u00a0 Ganczarski lived at times with his family at al Qaeda\u2019s fortified compound near Kandahar, Afghanistan.\u00a0 At other times, Ganczarski lived in guest houses and other facilities operated by al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Ganczarski participated in al Qaeda\u2019s efforts to kill Americans in a number of ways, such as providing al Adel and other al Qaeda members with technological guidance and hardware, including computers, radios and other communications equipment.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>In approximately January 2000, Ganczarski attended a speech delivered by bin Laden at al Qaeda\u2019s headquarters in Kandahar.\u00a0 The January 2000 speech was attended by at least 100 men, including, among others, many significant al Qaeda leaders and terrorists, such as at least one of the plotters in the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in East Africa, and one of the future hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States (the September 11 Attacks).\u00a0 During the speech, Ganczarski sat in the front row with al Adel\u2019s son in his lap.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>In approximately March 2000, Ganczarski attended a meeting in Karachi, Pakistan, between Mohammad and a member of Jamaah Islamiyah (CC-1), a Southeast Asia terrorist organization, at which U.S. and Israeli targets for terrorist attacks were discussed.\u00a0 Following the meeting, Ganczarski helped transport CC-1 and a written communication from Mohammad to al Qaeda\u2019s fortified compound in Kandahar, where Ganczarski spoke to bin Laden and took CC-1 to meetings with al Adel and Abu Hafs el Masri at which potential attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests were further discussed.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Ganczarski was in Germany at the time of the September 11 Attacks, and he indicated after the attacks that he had been aware that a significant event was about to occur.\u00a0 In approximately early October 2001, Ganczarski returned to Afghanistan and met with other members of al Qaeda, including al Adel.\u00a0 In approximately November 2001, Ganczarski and others attempted to repair anti-aircraft missiles controlled by al Qaeda that were not functioning, so that the missiles could be fired at U.S. military aircraft flying in the area at the time.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Ganczarski was arrested in France in 2003, and subsequently convicted of offenses under French law relating to a 2002 al Qaeda attack on a synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia.\u00a0 Ganczarski has been incarcerated in France since being convicted. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

counts: one count of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison; two counts of conspiracy to provide material support and resources to terrorists, and provision of material support and resources to terrorists, which carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison on each count; and one count of conspiracy to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization (al Qaeda) which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>The maximum potential penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.\u00a0 The charges contained in the Superseding Indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Mr. Boente and Mr. Berman praised the extraordinary investigative work of the FBI\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force \u2013 which principally consists of agents from the FBI and detectives from the NYPD \u2013 for the critical role they played and continue to play in the investigation of Ganczarski and his co-conspirators.\u00a0 In addition, Mr. Berman thanked the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Emil J. Bove III and Amanda L. Houle of the Southern District of New York are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Smith of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section. </span></span></p></div>",

Today\u2019s conviction ensures that Mr. Wright will never again endanger the lives of innocent Americans or recruit others on behalf of a violent enemy of this country.

It reflects the true gravity of Mr. Wright's crimes, betraying his country, conspiring to support a terrorist organization dedicated to the murder of innocent people, and obstructing an investigation,\u201d said SAC Shaw. \u201cMr. Wright was a soldier of ISIS right here in Massachusetts and his plan to carry out terror attacks was a very real threat. \u00a0This case is a testament to the tireless efforts of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The close coordination between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, combined with trusted international partnerships, led to the disruption of this plot.

Within minutes of learning this from a family member, Wright deleted data from his laptop computer by restoring it to factory settings and deleting call logs on his cellphone that showed he had spoken to Rahim that morning.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>The charge of conspiracy to provide material support carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a lifetime term of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 The charge of obstruction of justice carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.\u00a0 The charge of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, a lifetime term of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 <span>The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. \u00a0The sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court after considering the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>This investigation was conducted by the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF); the Boston Police Department; Massachusetts State Police; Everett Police Department; and Customs and Border Protection.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney B.

Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Steven W. Myhre of the District of Nevada, U.S. Attorney John A.

Jones of the Northern District of Georgia.\u00a0 Seleznev pleaded guilty to one count of participation in a racketeering enterprise pursuant to an indictment returned in the District of Nevada, and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud pursuant to an indictment returned in the Northern District of Georgia.\u00a0 He will be sentenced on December 11.\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>In connection with his guilty plea in the Nevada case, Seleznev admitted that he became associated with the Carder.su organization in January 2009. According to Seleznev\u2019s admissions in his plea agreement, Carder.su was an Internet-based, international criminal enterprise whose members trafficked in compromised credit card account data and counterfeit identifications and committed identity theft, bank fraud and computer crimes. Seleznev admitted that the group tried to protect the anonymity and the security of the enterprise from both rival organizations and law enforcement. For example, members communicated through various secure and encrypted forums, such as chatrooms, private messaging systems, encrypted email, proxies and encrypted virtual private networks. Gaining membership in the group required the recommendation of two current members in good standing. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Seleznev further admitted that he sold compromised credit card account data and other personal identifying information to fellow Carder.su members. </span></span><span><span>The defendant sold members such a large volume of product that he created an automated website, which he advertised on the Carder.su organization\u2019s websites. His automated website allowed members to log into and purchase stolen credit card account data. The defendant\u2019s website had a simple interface that allowed members to search for the particular type of credit card information they wanted to buy, add the number of accounts they wished to purchase to their \u201cshopping cart\u201d and upon check out, download the purchased credit card information. Payment of funds was automatically deducted from an established account funded through L.R., an on-line digital currency payment system. Seleznev admitted that he sold each account number for approximately $20.\u00a0 The Carder.su organization\u2019s criminal activities resulted in loss to its victims of at least $50,983,166.35.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>In connection with his guilty plea in the Northern District of Georgia case, Seleznev admitted that he acted as a \u201ccasher\u201d who worked with hackers to coordinate a scheme to defraud an Atlanta-based company that processed credit and debit card transactions on behalf of financial institutions.\u00a0 Seleznev admitted that pursuant to the scheme, in November 2008, hackers infiltrated the company\u2019s computer systems and stole 45.5 million debit card numbers, certain of which they used to fraudulently withdraw over $9.4 million from 2,100 ATMs in 280 cities around the world in less than 12 hours.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Fifty-five individuals were charged in four separate indictments in Operation Open Market, which targeted the Carder.su organization. To date, 33individuals have been convicted and the rest are either fugitives or are pending trial. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>The cases were investigated by HSI and the U.S. Secret Service.\u00a0 The Nevada case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Catherine Dick of the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly M. Frayn of the District of Nevada.\u00a0 The Northern District of Georgia case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kamal Ghali of the Northern District of Georgia.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Seleznev is also a defendant in a wire fraud and computer hacking case brought by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.\u00a0 On Aug. 25, 2016, a federal jury convicted Seleznev of 38 counts related to his role in a scheme to hack into point-of-sale computers to steal and sell credit card numbers to the criminal underworld. \u00a0On April 21, Seleznev was sentenced to 27 years in prison for those crimes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span></p></div>",

Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; Acting U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick of the District of New Jersey; Acting Special Agent in Charge Debra Parker of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Newark; and Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir Grewal made the announcement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rosario La Marca, 54, a resident of Naples, Italy, pleaded guilty on February 22, before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to Count One of an indictment charging him with conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, to smuggle goods into the U.S., and to structure financial transactions, and Count Two, charging him with trafficking in counterfeit goods. Judge McNulty imposed the sentence today in Newark federal court.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to facts admitted during the plea, from July 2009 through February 2014,\u00a0 La Marca, Andreina Becerra, 32, a Venezuelan national, Roberto Volpe, 35, an Italian national, and Jianhua Li, 42, conspired to smuggle into the U.S. from China more than 40,000 electronic devices and accessories bearing counterfeit Apple and Sony trademarks. The estimated manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices for an equivalent number of genuine items would have exceeded $15 million. The devices were shipped separately from the labels bearing counterfeit trademarks in order to avoid detection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The devices were then labeled and packaged after they passed through customs.</span></p>\n<p><span>The defendants then re-shipped the devices to conspirators all over the U.S. Proceeds from the sales of the devices were funneled back to the defendants\u2019 accounts in Florida and New Jersey via structured cash deposits \u2013 broken into multiple deposits of less than $10,000 each to avoid bank reporting requirements \u2013 and a portion of the proceeds was then transferred to conspirators in Italy, further disguising the source of the funds.</span></p>\n<p><span>The defendants made more than 100 illegal wire transfers totaling more than $1.1 million to Hong Kong to facilitate their criminal activity.\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p>In addition to the prison term, Judge McNulty sentenced La Marca to one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p>Volpe and Becerra have both pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme and await sentencing.

Cazes and his wife amassed numerous high value assets, including luxury vehicles, residences and a hotel in Thailand. Cazes also possessed millions of dollars in cryptocurrency, which has been seized by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>According to publicly available information on AlphaBay prior to its takedown, </span></span><span>one AlphaBay staff member claimed that it serviced over 200,000 users and 40,000 vendors.\u00a0 Around the time of takedown, there were over 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals on AlphaBay, and over 100,000 listings for stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms and fraudulent services. Comparatively, the Silk Road dark web marketplace, which was seized by law enforcement in November 2013, had reportedly approximately 14,000 listings for illicit goods and services at the time of seizure and was the largest dark web marketplace at the time.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is likely one of the most important criminal investigations of the year \u2013 taking down the largest dark net marketplace in history,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cMake no mistake, the forces of law and justice face a new challenge from the criminals and transnational criminal organizations who think they can commit their crimes with impunity using the dark net.\u00a0 The dark net is not a place to hide. The Department will continue to find, arrest, prosecute, convict, and incarcerate criminals, drug traffickers and their enablers wherever they are. We will use every tool we have to stop criminals from exploiting vulnerable people and sending so many Americans to an early grave. I believe that because of this operation, the American people are safer \u2013 safer from the threat of identity fraud and malware, and safer from deadly drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p><span>\u201cTransnational organized crime poses a serious threat to our national and economic security,\u201d said Acting Director Andrew McCabe of the FBI. \u201cWhether they operate in broad daylight or on the dark net, we will never stop working to find and stop these criminal syndicates.\u00a0 We want to thank our international partners and those at the Department of Justice, the DEA and the IRS-CI for their hard work in demonstrating what we can do when we stand together.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cThe so-called anonymity of the dark web is illusory,\u201d said Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg of the DEA. \u201cWe will find and prosecute drug traffickers who set up shop there, and this case is a great example of our commitment to doing exactly that. More to come.\u201d </span></span></p>\n<p><span>\u201cAlphaBay was the world\u2019s largest underground marketplace of the dark net, providing an avenue for criminals to conduct business anonymously and without repercussions,\u201d said Chief Don Fort of IRS-CI. \u201cWorking with our law enforcement partners</span> \u2013 <span>both domestically and abroad</span> \u2013 <span>IRS-CI used its unique financial and cyber expertise to help shine a bright light on the accounts and customers of this shadowy black marketplace, and we intend to continue pursuing these kinds of criminals no matter where they hide.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cThis ranks as one of the most successful coordinated takedowns against cybercrime in recent years,\u201d said </span><span>Executive </span><span>Director Rob Wainwright of Europol. \u201cConcerted action by law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe, with the support of Europol, has delivered a massive blow to the underground criminal economy and sends a clear message that the dark web is not a safe area for criminals. I pay tribute to the excellent work of the United States and European authorities for the imaginative and resourceful way they combined their efforts in this case.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>AlphaBay operated as a hidden service on the \u201cTor\u201d network, and utilized cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Monero and Ethereum in order to hide the locations of its underlying servers and the identities of its administrators, moderators, and users. </span></span><span>B</span><span><span>ased on law enforcement\u2019s investigation of AlphaBay, authorities believe the site was also used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from illegal transactions on the website.\u00a0 </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>An investigation conducted by FBI Atlanta and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Northern District of Georgia identified an AlphaBay staffer living in the United States. That investigation is ongoing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The investigation into AlphaBay revealed that numerous vendors sold fentanyl and heroin, and there have been multiple overdose deaths across the country attributed to purchases on the site.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>According to a complaint affidavit filed in the District of South Carolina against Theodore Vitality Khleborod and Ana Milena Barrero, an investigation into an overdose death on February 16, in Portland, Oregon, involving </span><span>U-47700, a synthetic opioid, revealed that the drugs were purchased on AlphaBay from Khelborod and Barrero. According to another complaint affidavit filed in the Middle District of Florida against Jeremy Achey, an investigation into a fentanyl overdose death in Orange County, Florida, on February 27, revealed that the lethal substance was purchased on AlphaBay from Achey.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Charges contained in an indictment and/or complaint are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>This operation to seize the AlphaBay site coincides with efforts by Dutch law enforcement to investigate and take down the Hansa Market, another prominent dark web market. Like AlphaBay, Hansa Market was used to facilitate the sale of illegal drugs, toxic chemicals, malware, counterfeit identification documents, and illegal services. The administrators of Hansa Market, along with its thousands of vendors and users, also attempted to mask their identities to avoid prosecution through the use of Tor and digital currency. Further information on the operation against the Hansa Market can be obtained from Dutch authorities.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The operation to seize AlphaBay\u2019s servers was announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions; </span></span><span>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; <span>Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert for the Eastern District of California; Acting Director Andrew G. McCabe of the FBI, Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg of the DEA and </span>Europol Executive Director Robert Mark Wainwright<span>. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The case is being investigated by the FBI including FBI Sacramento Field Office and DEA, with substantial assistance from the IRS-CI. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations also assisted in the investigation. The case against Cazes was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul A. Hemesath and Grant B. Rabenn of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California, and Trial Attorneys Louisa K. Marion and C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. Substantial assistance was provided by the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs and Special Operations Division.\u00a0 Additionally, the following foreign law enforcement agencies provided substantial assistance in the operation to seize AlphaBay\u2019s infrastructure: Royal Thai Police, Dutch National Police, </span></span><span>Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau (LCPB)<span>, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency, Europol, and French National Police.\u00a0 </span></span></p></div>",

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory G. Brooker of the District of Minnesota; and Special Agent in Charge Richard T. Thornton of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Peteris Sahurovs aka \u201cPiotrek\u201d aka \u201cSagade,\u201d was indicted in 2011 in the District of Minnesota on charges of wire fraud, computer fraud and conspiracy. Sahurovs was arrested on the indictment in Latvia in June of 2011. He was released by a Latvian court and later fled. In November of 2016, Sahurovs was located in Poland and apprehended by Polish law enforcement, after which the U.S. began extradition proceedings. Sahurovs was at one time the FBI\u2019s fifth most wanted cybercriminal and a reward of up to $50,000 had been offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction.</p>\n<p>Scareware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that poses as legitimate computer security software and purports to detect a variety of threats on the affected computer that do not actually exist. Computer users are informed they must purchase what they are told is anti-virus software in order to repair their computers. The users are then barraged with aggressive and disruptive notifications \u2013 and sometimes prevented from using their computer \u2013 until they supply their credit card number and pay for a fraudulent \u201canti-virus\u201d product.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Sahurovs and members of the conspiracy relied on fraudulent online advertising to spread their malware. The defendants created a phony advertising agency and claimed that they represented an American hotel chain that wanted to purchase online advertising space on the Minneapolis Star Tribune\u2019s news website, startribune.com. After their advertisement began running on the website, the defendants changed the computer code in the ad so that the computers of visitors to the startribune.com were infected with malware.</p>\n<p>The indictment alleges that the malware caused users\u2019 computers to \u201cfreeze up\u201d and then generate a series of pop-up warnings in an attempt to trick users into purchasing purported \u201cantivirus\u201d software to fix the problems created by the malware. The \u201cantivirus\u201d software, if purchased, \u201cunfroze\u201d victim computers and stopped the pop-ups and security notifications, but the malware remained hidden on their computers. Users who failed to purchase the \u201cantivirus\u201d software found that all information, data and files stored on the computer became inaccessible. The scheme generated more than $2 million in proceeds.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>\n<p><span><span>This case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy C. Rank of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney Aaron R. Cooper of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case. The Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter. The Latvian State Police; and the Polish National Police, the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the Ministry of Justice also provided significant assistance and cooperation.</span></span></p></div>",

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p><span>Today, Xu Jiaqiang, 31, formerly of Beijing, China, pleaded guilty to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret, in connection with Xu\u2019s theft of proprietary source code from Xu\u2019s former employer, with the intent to benefit the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Xu pleaded guilty to all six counts with which he was charged. </span></p>\n<p><span>The announcement was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General for the National Security </span>Dana Boente and <span>Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim for the Southern District of New York. The pleas were entered before U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Karas </span>in White Plains, New York federal court.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, Xu pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from his former employer for his own profit and intending to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente. \u201cThe Economic Espionage Act is a key tool in protecting our economic and security interests. The National Security Division will pursue and prosecute any individual who steals intellectual property from American businesses to benefit a foreign government.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cXu Jiaqiang admitted and pled guilty today to stealing high tech trade secrets from a U.S. employer, intending to benefit the Chinese government. What Xu did was not only a federal crime, but a threat to our national security and the American spirit of innovation. Our Office is committed to finding, arresting and holding accountable those who take advantage of American businesses by engaging in economic espionage.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the Complaint and the Superseding Indictment filed against Xu, as well as statements made in related court filings and proceedings:</p>\n<p>From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a U.S. company (the \u201cVictim Company\u201d). As a developer, Xu enjoyed access to certain proprietary software (the \u201cProprietary Software\u201d), as well as that software\u2019s underlying source code (the \u201cProprietary Source Code\u201d). The Proprietary Software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the Victim Company in the U.S. and other countries. A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers. The Victim Company took significant precautions to protect the Proprietary Source Code as a trade secret. Among other things, the Proprietary Source Code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed only by a small subset of the Victim Company\u2019s employees. Before receiving Proprietary Source Code access, Victim Company employees must first request and receive approval from a Victim Company official. Victim Company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information. The Victim Company took these and other precautions in part because the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code are economically valuable, which value depends in part on the Proprietary Source Code\u2019s secrecy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the Victim Company. Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer (\u201cUC-1\u201d), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer (\u201cUC-2\u201d), who posed as a project manager, working for UC-1. In these communications, Xu discussed his past experience with the Victim Company and indicated that he had experience with the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code. On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu\u2019s prior work with the Victim Company. A Victim Company employee (\u201cEmployee-1\u201d) later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary Victim Company material that related to the Proprietary Source Code.</span></p>\n<p>Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that Xu was willing to consider providing UC-2\u2019s company with the Proprietary Source Code as a platform for UC-2\u2019s company to facilitate the development of its own data storage system. Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the Proprietary Software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.</p>\n<p>In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu\u2019s specifications. Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network (the \u201cXu Upload\u201d). Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the Xu Upload. In September 2015, the FBI made the Xu Upload available to a Victim Company employee who has expertise regarding the Proprietary Software and the Proprietary Source Code (\u201cEmployee-2\u201d). Based on Employee-2\u2019s analysis of technical features of the Xu Upload, it appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload contained a functioning copy of the Proprietary Software. It further appeared to Employee-2 that the Xu Upload had been built by someone with access to the Proprietary Source Code who was not working within the Victim Company or otherwise at the Victim Company\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York (the \u201cHotel\u201d).\u00a0 Xu stated, in sum and substance, that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to make software to sell to customers, that Xu knew the Proprietary Source Code to be the product of decades of work on the part of the Victim Company, and that Xu had used the Proprietary Source Code to build a copy of the Proprietary Software, which Xu had uploaded and installed on the UC Network (<i>i.e.</i>, the Xu Upload). Xu also indicated that Xu knew the copy of the Proprietary Software that Xu had installed on the UC Network contained information identifying the Proprietary Software as the Victim Company\u2019s property, which could reveal the fact that the Proprietary Software had been built with the Proprietary Source Code without the Victim Company\u2019s authorization. Xu told UC-2 that Xu could take steps to prevent detection of the Proprietary Software\u2019s origins \u2013 <i>i.e.</i>, that it had been built with stolen Proprietary Source Code \u2013 including writing computer scripts that would modify the Proprietary Source Code to conceal its origins.</p>\n<p>Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the Hotel. During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what Xu represented to be the Proprietary Source Code on Xu\u2019s laptop. Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the Victim Company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted. Xu also stated that Xu had previously modified the Proprietary Source Code\u2019s command interface to conceal the fact that the Proprietary Source Code originated with the Victim Company and identified multiple specific customers to whom Xu had previously provided the Proprietary Software using Xu\u2019s stolen copy of the Proprietary Source Code.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In connection with the economic espionage counts charged in the Superseding Indictment, Xu stole, duplicated, and possessed the Proprietary Source Code with the intent to benefit the National Health and Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p>\n<p><span>Xu pleaded guilty to </span>three counts of economic espionage, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and three counts of theft of a trade secret, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. <span>The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</span></p>\n<p><span>Xu\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for October 13.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mr. Kim </span>praised the FBI\u2019s outstanding investigative efforts. He also thanked the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit and its White Plains Division. The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee, Ilan Graff and Shane T. Stansbury for the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p></div>",

Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes of the Western District of Washington.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Roman Valeryevich Seleznev, aka Track2, was convicted in August 2016, of 38 counts related to his scheme to hack into point-of-sale computers to steal credit card numbers and sell them on dark market websites.\u00a0\u00a0U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones of the Western District of Washington imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis investigation, conviction and sentence demonstrates that the United States will bring the full force of the American justice system upon cybercriminals like Seleznev who victimize U.S. citizens and companies from afar,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd we will not tolerate the existence of safe havens for these crimes \u2013 we will identify cybercriminals from the dark corners of the Internet and bring them to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday is a bad day for hackers around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes.\u00a0\u201cThe notion that the Internet is a Wild West where anything goes is a thing of the past.\u00a0\u00a0As Mr. Seleznev has now learned, and others should take note \u2013 we are working closely with our law enforcement partners around the world to find, apprehend, and bring to justice those who use the internet to steal and destroy our peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0Whether the victims are multi-national banks or small pizza joints, we are all victims when our day-to-day transactions result in millions of dollars ending up in the wrong hands.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to evidence presented at trial, between October 2009 and October 2013, Seleznev hacked into retail point-of-sale systems and installed malicious software (malware) that allowed him to steal millions of credit card numbers from more than 500 U.S. businesses and send the data to servers that he controlled in Russia, the Ukraine and McLean, Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0Seleznev then bundled the credit card information into groups called \u201cbases\u201d and sold the information on various criminal \u201ccarding\u201d websites to buyers who used them for fraudulent purchases, according to evidence introduced during the trial of this case.\u00a0<br/>\nMany of the businesses targeted by Seleznev were small businesses, and included restaurants and pizza parlors in Western Washington, including Broadway Grill in Seattle, which was forced into bankruptcy following the cyber assault.\u00a0\u00a0Testimony at trial revealed that Seleznev\u2019s scheme caused approximately 3,700 financial institutions more than $169 million in losses.</p>\n<p>Seleznev was taken into custody in July 2014 in the Maldives, and the laptop in his custody at that time contained more than 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, including some from businesses in Western Washington.\u00a0\u00a0The laptop also contained additional evidence linking Seleznev to the servers, email accounts and financial transactions involved in the scheme.\u00a0\u00a0Evidence presented at trial showed that Seleznev earned tens of millions of dollars from his criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Seleznev was convicted on Aug. 25, 2016, of 10 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, nine counts of obtaining information from a protected computer, nine counts of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices and two counts of aggravated identity theft.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Seleznev\u2019s criminal enterprise was both sophisticated and expansive, with transnational implications.\u00a0\u00a0This investigation exemplifies the ability of the U.S. Secret Service and our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who perpetrate such crimes,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert L.

One of the defendants also exploited his access to Yahoo\u2019s network for his personal financial gain, by searching Yahoo user communications for credit card and gift card account numbers, redirecting a subset of Yahoo search engine web traffic so he could make commissions and enabling the theft of the contacts of at least 30 million Yahoo accounts to facilitate a spam campaign. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>The charges were announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions of the U.S. Department of Justice, Director James Comey of the FBI, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Mary McCord, U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch for the Northern District of California and Executive Assistant Director Paul Abbate of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>\u201cCyber crime poses a significant threat to our nation\u2019s security and prosperity, and this is one of the largest data breaches in history,\u201d said Attorney General Sessions. \u201cBut thanks to the tireless efforts of U.S. prosecutors and investigators, as well as our Canadian partners, today we have identified four individuals, including two Russian FSB officers, responsible for unauthorized access to millions of users\u2019 accounts. The United States will vigorously investigate and prosecute the people behind such attacks to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>\u201cToday we continue to pierce the veil of anonymity surrounding cyber crimes,\u201d said Director Comey. \u201cWe are shrinking the world to ensure that cyber criminals think twice before targeting U.S. persons and interests.\u201d</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>\u201c The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI\u2019s point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \u201cOnce again, the Department and the FBI have demonstrated that hackers around the world can and will be exposed and held accountable. State actors may be using common criminals to access the data they want, but the indictment shows that our companies do not have to stand alone against this threat. We commend Yahoo and Google for their sustained and invaluable cooperation in the investigation aimed at obtaining justice for, and protecting the privacy of their users.\u201d</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>\u00a0\u201c</span></span></span><span><span><span>This is a highly complicated investigation of a very complex threat. It underscores the value of early, proactive engagement and cooperation between the private sector and the government,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Abbate. \u201cThe FBI will continue to work relentlessly with our private sector and international partners to identify those who conduct cyber-attacks against our citizens and our nation, expose them and hold them accountable under the law, no mat</span></span></span><span><span><span>ter where they attempt to hide.\u201d</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span>\u00a0\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s computer infrastructure provides the means by which people around the world communicate with each other in their business and personal lives. The privacy and security of those communications must be governed by the rule of law, not by the whim of criminal hackers and those who employ them. People rightly expect that their communications through Silicon Valley internet providers will remain private, unless lawful authority provides otherwise. We will not tolerate unauthorized and illegal intrusions into the Silicon Valley computer infrastructure upon which both private citizens and the global economy rely,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Stretch. \u201cWorking closely with Yahoo and Google, Department of Justice lawyers and the FBI were able to identify and expose the hackers responsible for the conduct described today, without unduly intruding into the privacy of the accounts that were stolen. We commend Yahoo and Google for providing exemplary cooperation while zealously protecting their users\u2019 privacy.\u201d</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Summary of Allegations</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>According to the allegations of the Indictment:</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>The FSB officer defendants, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, protected, directed, facilitated and paid </span></span></span><span><span><span>criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the U.S. and elsewhere. </span></span></span><span><span><span>In the present case, they worked with co-defendants Alexsey Belan and Karim Baratov to obtain access to the email accounts of thousands of individuals.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Belan had been publicly indicted in September 2012 and June 2013 and was named one of FBI\u2019s Cyber Most Wanted criminals in November 2013. An Interpol Red Notice seeking his immediate detention has been lodged (including with Russia) since July 26, 2013. Belan was arrested in a European country on a request from the U.S. in June 2013, but he was able to escape to Russia before he could be extradited.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Instead of acting on the U.S. government\u2019s Red Notice and detaining Belan after his return, Dokuchaev and Sushchin subsequently used him to gain unauthorized access to Yahoo\u2019s network. In or around November and December 2014, Belan stole a copy of at least a portion of Yahoo\u2019s User Database (UDB), a Yahoo trade secret that contained, among other data, subscriber information including users\u2019 names, recovery email accounts, phone numbers and certain information required to manually create, or \u201cmint,\u201d account authentication web browser \u201ccookies\u201d for more than 500 million Yahoo accounts.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Belan also obtained unauthorized access on behalf of the FSB conspirators to Yahoo\u2019s Account Management Tool (AMT), which was a proprietary means by which Yahoo made and logged changes to user accounts. Belan, Dokuchaev and Sushchin then used the stolen UDB copy and AMT access to locate Yahoo email accounts of interest and to mint cookies for those accounts, enabling the co-conspirators to access at least 6,500 such accounts without authorization.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Some victim accounts were of predictable interest to the FSB, a foreign intelligence and law enforcement service, such as personal accounts belonging to Russian journalists; Russian and U.S. government officials; employees of a prominent Russian cybersecurity company; and numerous employees of other providers whose networks the conspirators sought to exploit. However, other personal accounts belonged to employees of commercial entities, such as a Russian investment banking firm, a French transportation company, U.S. financial services and private equity firms, a Swiss bitcoin wallet and banking firm and a U.S. airline.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>During the conspiracy, the FSB officers facilitated Belan\u2019s other criminal activities, by providing him with sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by U.S. and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia, including information regarding FSB investigations of computer hacking and FSB techniques for identifying criminal hackers. Additionally, while working with his FSB conspirators to compromise Yahoo\u2019s network and its users, Belan used his access to steal financial information such as gift card and credit card numbers from webmail accounts; to gain access to more than 30 million accounts whose contacts were then stolen to facilitate a spam campaign; and to earn commissions from fraudulently redirecting a subset of Yahoo\u2019s search engine traffic.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>When Dokuchaev and Sushchin learned that a target of interest had accounts at webmail providers other than Yahoo, including through information obtained as part of the Yahoo intrusion, they tasked their co-conspirator, Baratov, a resident of Canada, with obtaining unauthorized access to more than 80 accounts in exchange for commissions. On March 7, the Department of Justice submitted a provisional arrest warrant to Canadian law enforcement authorities, requesting Baratov\u2019s arrest. On March 14, Baratov was arrested in Canada and the matter is now pending with the Canadian authorities.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>The FBI, led by the San Francisco Field Office, conducted the investigation that resulted in the charges announced today. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, with support from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><b><span><span><span>Defendants:</span></span></span></b><span><span><span> At all times relevant to the charges, the Indictment alleges as follows:</span></span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span><span><span>Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev</span></span></span></b><span><span><span>, 33, was an officer in the FSB Center for Information Security, aka \u201cCenter 18.\u201d Dokuchaev was a Russian national and resident.</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span><span><span>Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin</span></span></span></b><span><span><span>, 43, was an FSB officer, a superior to Dokuchaev within the FSB, and a Russian national and resident.

Blanco of the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger of the District of Minnesota, Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and Special Agent in Charge Richard T. Thornton of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Division made the announcement.</p>\n<p>John L. Steele, 45, currently residing in Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering before U.S. District Judge Joan N. Ericksen of the District of Minnesota.\u00a0\u00a0Sentencing has not yet been scheduled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to Steele\u2019s admissions in the plea, between 2011 and 2014, Steele and co-defendant Paul Hansmeier, both practicing lawyers, executed a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $6 million by threatening copyright lawsuits against individuals who supposedly downloaded pornographic movies from file-sharing websites.\u00a0\u00a0Steele admitted that he and Hansmeier created a series of sham entities to obtain copyrights to pornographic movies \u2013 some of which they filmed themselves \u2013 and then uploaded those movies to file-sharing websites like \u201cThe Pirate Bay\u201d in order to lure people to download the movies.\u00a0\u00a0Steele and Hansmeier then filed bogus copyright infringement lawsuits that concealed their role in distributing the movies, as well as their personal stake in the outcome of the litigation.\u00a0\u00a0After fraudulently inducing courts into giving him and co-defendants the power to subpoena Internet service providers and thereby identify the subscriber who controlled the IP address used to download the movie, Steele and Hansmeier used extortionate tactics such as letters and phone calls to threaten victims with enormous financial penalties and public embarrassment unless they agreed to pay a $3,000 settlement fee.</p>\n<p>To distance themselves from the specious lawsuits and any potential fallout, Steele admitted that he and co-defendants created and used Prenda Law, among other firms, to pursue their claims.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the plea, after various courts began to restrict the defendant\u2019s ability to sue multiple individuals in the same copyright lawsuit, the defendant changed his tactics and began filing lawsuits falsely alleging that computer systems belonging to their sham clients had been hacked.\u00a0\u00a0To facilitate their phony \u201chacking\u201d lawsuits, Steele and Hansmeier recruited \u201cruse defendants,\u201d who had been caught downloading pornography from a file-sharing website, to be sued in exchange for Steele and Hansmeier waiving their settlement fees while pursuing claims against their supposed \u201cco-conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the plea agreement, as courts began to uncover the defendant\u2019s unscrupulous litigation tactics, judges began denying the defendant\u2019s requests to subpoena ISPs, dismissing lawsuits, accusing Steele and co-defendants of deceptive and fraudulent behavior and imposing sanctions against the Steele and his associates.\u00a0\u00a0For example, on May 6, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued an order imposing sanctions against the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0In total, the Steele and co-defendants obtained approximately $6 million from the fraudulent copyright lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Paul R. Hansmeier, of St. Paul, Minnesota, was charged as a co-defendant in an indictment filed on Dec. 16, 2016.\u00a0\u00a0The charges contained in the indictment against him are merely accusations, and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>\n<p>FBI and IRS-CI are investigating the case.\u00a0\u00a0Senior Trial Counsel Brian Levine of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Langner of the District of Minnesota are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/press-release/file/946376/dl?inline\" title=\"steele_plea_agreement_1.pdf\">steele_plea_agreement_1.pdf</a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>",

Melnik, 30, of Las Vegas, remit $200,000 in restitution and forfeit $1.2 million in proceeds derived from the scheme as well as property seized during the investigation.\u00a0\u00a0Melnik pleaded guilty before Judge Mahan on Sept. 8, 2016, to one count of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and to introduce into interstate commerce misbranded devices.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the plea agreement, Melnik imported large quantities of colored contact lenses from the People\u2019s Republic of China and South Korea that he knew were counterfeit and/or unauthorized by the FDA for sale in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these contact lenses bore labels with counterfeit trademarks for Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS, which are manufactured by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and others bore labels of contact lense brands produced and sold in Asia, he admitted.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As stipulated in the plea agreement, contact lenses\u2014even decorative ones\u2014are medical devices that if not fitted, worn, or cared for properly can result in serious eye injury including blindness, and must receive prior FDA authorization to enter the U.S. and be further distributed.\u00a0\u00a0Melnik admitted, however, that he sold purportedly \u201cauthentic\u201d contact lenses to tens of thousands of customers around the United States without a prescription, adequate directions for use or adequate warnings.\u00a0\u00a0After purchasing the contact lenses, many customers complained directly to Melnik about the quality of the contact lenses and questioned Melnik about whether the contact lenses were genuine and FDA approved.\u00a0\u00a0Melnik admitted that many of the contact lenses that he sold were substandard, and that some were tested and found to be contaminated with a potentially dangerous bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As stated in the plea agreement, a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States, and Melnik received at least $1.2 million in gross revenue from this illegal enterprise, including approximately $200,000 alone from the sale of counterfeit Ciba Vision FreshLook COLORBLENDS.</p>\n<p>Anyone with information about individuals committing intellectual property offenses can report those crimes to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center by going to <a href=\"http://www.iprcenter.gov/referral\">http://www.iprcenter.gov/referral </a>or calling (866) IPR-2060.</p>\n<p>The prosecution is the result of an ongoing multiagency effort to combat counterfeit, illegally imported and unapproved contact lenses called Operation Double Vision.\u00a0\u00a0The FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations led the investigation, with significant support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations.\u00a0\u00a0Senior Counsel Matthew A. Lamberti of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Cowhig of the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The indictment is related to the many efforts being undertaken by the department\u2019s Task Force on Intellectual Property, which supports prosecution priorities, promotes innovation through heightened civil enforcement, enhances coordination among federal, state and local law enforcement partners and focuses on international enforcement efforts, including reinforcing relationships with key foreign partners and U.S. industry leaders.</p></div>",

Kaliebe pleaded guilty to both counts of a felony information, which charged him with attempting to provide material support to terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A(a), and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as Ansar al-Sharia (collectively, AQAP), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B(a)(1).</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>The sentencing was announced by Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Mary B. McCord, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers for the Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney, Jr. of the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office and Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill of the New York City Police Department (NYPD).</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\"With this sentence, Justin Kaliebe is being held accountable for his attempt to travel overseas to join Al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula and engage in violent jihad,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \"One of our highest priorities is to protect our country by identifying, disrupting and holding accountable those who provide or attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cThis case is a sobering reminder that the call to violent jihad can reach deep into our local communities. Even when given the opportunity to abandon his plan to join al-Qaeda, this defendant made clear his intentions to commit himself fully to terrorism,\u201d stated U.S. Attorney Capers. \u201cIf not for the vigilance and commitment of our dedicated investigators, he might well have succeeded in empowering a dangerous enemy.\u201d Mr. Capers expressed his sincere appreciation to all the members of the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) and the NYPD Intelligence Division for their work on the investigation.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>\u201cProviding material support to terrorists is a serious crime that should have serious consequences. Today\u2019s sentencing of Justin Kaliebe shows just that. Kaliebe set out to provide material support to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in 2013 by attempting to travel to Yemen, after making plans months in advance. He didn\u2019t get past JFK thanks to the hard work of the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force and the NYPD Intelligence Division,\u201d stated Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span>\u201c</span></span></span><span><span>Kaliebe\u2019s commitment to join al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was as alarming as it was sinister. And early in 2013, Kaliebe was arrested at John F. Kennedy airport trying to fulfill his dream of joining the jihad in Yemen. Thankfully, Kaliebe was met at the airport by NYPD detectives and FBI agents investigating his support of this terrorist group\u2019s agenda. Thanks, as always, to those on the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force and at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Eastern District for their investigation of this case and many others</span></span><span><span><span>,\u201d stated Commissioner </span></span></span><span><span>O\u2019Neill.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>According to the court filings, including sentencing memoranda, and evidence introduced during a sentencing hearing, Kaliebe attempted to travel from the U.S. to Yemen for the purpose of joining AQAP and waging violent jihad. During numerous meetings and recorded conversations and email correspondence with undercover law enforcement officers, Kaliebe explained that he had been searching for an opportunity to travel abroad and fight jihad for two years \u2013 long before Kaliebe first approached the undercover officers about his plans to join a terrorist group. Kaliebe repeatedly expressed his desire to travel to Yemen in order to join AQAP and to help carry out its violent extremist agenda. </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Kaliebe also demonstrated extensive knowledge of terrorist organizations, including AQAP and al-Qaeda, and current and former leaders of those terrorist organizations. For example, Kaliebe referenced, and at times quoted, Anwar al-Awlaki, the now-deceased former member and senior leader of AQAP, as well as Omar Abdel Rahman (the \u201cBlind Sheik\u201d), Ayman al-Zawahiri, t</span></span><span><span>he current leader of al-Qaeda,</span></span><span><span> and Usama Bin Laden. Further, Kaliebe demonstrated detailed knowledge of various terrorist attacks that were carried out by AQAP in Yemen, as well as other attacks carried out by al-Qaeda around the world.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>According to a June 4, 2012, recorded conversation, which was admitted into evidence during the sentencing hearing, Kaliebe observed that \u201cthe crime that they would charge people like us with\u201d was conspiracy \u201cto kill, maim and kidnap in foreign countries,\u201d a reference to a federal criminal statute that has previously been used to charge other individuals who departed or attempted to depart the U.S. in order to fight jihad abroad. Later, during that same conversation, Kaliebe stated that, once he arrived in Yemen, he expected to fight the \u201cYemeni army\u201d and \u201cthose who are fighting against the Sharia of Allah . . . whether it\u2019s the U.S. drones or the, their puppets, in the Yemeni army . . . or, who knows, if American agents or whatever, U.S. Special Forces . . . who they got over there.\u201d When asked if he was afraid to die, Kaliebe responded \u201cI wanna . . . . It\u2019s what anyone would want, any believer would want.\u201d During another recorded conversation described in the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum, which took place on July 9, 2012, Kaliebe stated that he had been inspired by several sheiks, including \u201cSheik Usama,\u201d \u201cwho showed how he could bring an entire nation to its knees.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Beginning in approximately July 2012, Kaliebe saved money to finance his travel to Yemen, which he then used to apply for and purchase a U.S. passport, and to purchase an airline ticket to Oman, from where he intended to travel by land to Yemen. During a recorded meeting on July 30, 2012, Kaliebe stated that he was saving money \u201cas a means to go to Yemen to fight jihad.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>On Dec. 26, 2012, Kaliebe sent an email in which he swore his loyalty to the leaders of AQAP and al-Qaeda, respectively, writing, \u201cI pledge my loyalty, allegiance and fidelity to the Mujahedeen of Al-Qaa'idah in the Arabian Peninsula and its leaders, Shaykh Abu Baseer Nasir Al-Wuhayshi and Shaykh Ayman Al-Zawahiri, hafidhahum Allah! May Allah accept this from me and may he allow me to fight in his cause til the day that I leave this dunya [this world].\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>On Jan. 8, 2013, Kaliebe reaffirmed his commitment to jihad, telling an NYPD Intelligence Division undercover officer, in a recorded conversation, which was also admitted into evidence during the sentencing hearing, that he understood \u201cthere\u2019s a way out, but for me, the only way out is [martyrdom].\u201d Additionally, Kaliebe paid homage to several terrorist leaders, telling the undercover law enforcement officer that: \u201c[My] standard is Abu Dujana. [M]y standard is Abu Mus\u2019ab Al-Zarqawi. My standard is Sheik Anwar Al-Awlaki and Sheik Usama, both who bore witness to the truth with their blood.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Finally, Kaliebe stated, \u201cOh Allah, please allow me, please allow me and my brother\u2026to fight jihad in your cause oh Allah. Oh Allah, please give us one of the two victories, victory on the ground or victory through [martyrdom.]\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>On Jan. 21, 2013, Kaliebe\u2019s efforts culminated in an attempt to board a flight to Muscat, Oman at John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, New York. He was arrested at the airport by members of the FBI\u2019s JTTF and the NYPD Intelligence Division. On Feb. 8, 2013, Kaliebe waived indictment and pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to AQAP and to attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Kaliebe\u2019s co-conspirator, Marcos Alonso Zea, who also attempted to travel to Yemen to join AQAP. Once Zea\u2019s own attempt failed, he assisted Kaliebe\u2019s efforts to join the terrorist group. Zea was previously convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>The government\u2019s case is being prosecuted jointly by the National Security and Cybercrime Section, and the Long Island Criminal Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Seth D. DuCharme and John J. Durham for the Eastern District of New York are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Trial Attorney Kelli Andrews of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section. </span></span></p></div>",

Sweeney Jr. said:\u00a0 \u201cThe subjects charged in this case allegedly stole nonpublic information through unauthorized access to law firms\u2019 computers, and used the information for their own personal gain.\u00a0 The FBI works around the clock to keep these types of alleged securities fraudsters and cyber criminals from trading on stolen information, potentially manipulating the market at the cost of legitimate investors, and harm to corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the superseding indictment (the \u201cIndictment\u201d)1:</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Law Firm-1 Hack and Insider Trading</u></strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>At all times relevant to the Indictment, Law Firm-1 was a U.S.-based international law firm with offices in New York, New York, which, among other services, provided advisory services to companies engaged in M&amp;A transactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The Contemplated Intermune Transaction</em></p>\n<p>In June 2014, Law Firm-1 was retained by a company not named in the Indictment (the \u201cCompany\u201d) in connection with a contemplated acquisition of Intermune, a publicly traded U.S.-based drug maker (the \u201cContemplated Intermune Transaction\u201d).\u00a0 A partner in the M&amp;A group at Law Firm-1 (\u201cPartner-1\u201d) was an attorney working on the Contemplated Intermune Transaction.</p>\n<p>Beginning on July 21, 2014, the Defendants began exchanging emails concerning, among other things, particular M&amp;A partners at Law Firm-1.\u00a0 In addition, on or about July 29, 2014, HONG emailed HUNG a list of eleven partners at Law Firm-1, including Partner-1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also beginning about July 2014, the Defendants, without authorization, caused one of Law Firm-1\u2019s web servers (the \u201cLaw Firm-1 Web Server\u201d) to be accessed by using the unlawfully obtained credentials of a Law Firm-1 employee.\u00a0 The Defendants then caused malware to be installed on the Law Firm-1 Web Server.\u00a0 The access to the Law Firm-1 Web Server allowed unauthorized access to at least one of Law Firm-1\u2019s email servers (the \u201cLaw Firm-1 Email Server\u201d), which contained the emails of Law Firm-1 employees, including Partner-1.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between about August 1 and August 15, 2014, Partner-1 was privy to Inside Information about the Contemplated Intermune Transaction.\u00a0 For example, on more than one occasion between August 7 and August 15, 2014, Partner-1 obtained information, including via email, about details of the proposed transaction, including the price per share the Company was considering offering to acquire Intermune.</p>\n<p>Between about August 1 and August 9, 2014, the Defendants caused more than 40 gigabytes of confidential data to be exfiltrated from the Law Firm-1 Email Server over the course of at least eight days.</p>\n<p>On August 13, 2014, during the time Law Firm-1 was advising the Company on the Contemplated Intermune Transaction and after the Defendants had obtained access to confidential email data maintained at Law Firm-1, HONG used the Inside Information to purchase 7,500 shares of Intermune stock for certain trading accounts (the \u201cTrading Accounts\u201d).\u00a0 Prior to that date, none of the Trading Accounts had purchased any shares of Intermune.\u00a0 Later that day, HONG purchased an additional 1,000 shares of Intermune stock in the Trading Accounts.</p>\n<p>On August 16 and 17, 2014, the Defendants exploited their continued unauthorized access to email data belonging to Law Firm-1 by exfiltrating approximately 10 gigabytes of confidential data from the Law Firm-1 Email Server. \u00a0Between about August 18 and August 21, 2014, HONG and ZHENG used the Inside Information to purchase additional Intermune shares in the Trading Accounts on at least five occasions, totaling an additional 9,500 shares of Intermune stock.</p>\n<p>The Contemplated Intermune Transaction was never consummated.\u00a0 Instead, before the market opened on Monday, August 25, 2014, Intermune announced that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by Roche AG, a German company.\u00a0 On that day, Intermune\u2019s share price increased by approximately $19 per share, or approximately 40 percent from the closing price on Friday, August 22, 2014, the last prior trading day.\u00a0 That same day, August 25, 2014, the Defendants sold the 18,000 shares that they had begun acquiring twelve days earlier for profits of approximately $380,000.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The Intel-Altera Transaction</em></p>\n<p>In January 2015, Law Firm-1 was retained by Intel Corporation (\u201cIntel\u201d), a publicly traded multinational technology company, in connection with a contemplated acquisition of Altera Corporation (\u201cAltera\u201d), a publicly traded integrated circuit manufacturer (the \u201cIntel-Altera Transaction\u201d).\u00a0 As with the Contemplated Intermune Transaction, Partner-1 was an attorney working on the Intel-Altera Transaction.</p>\n<p>Between January and about March 27, 2015, Partner-1 was privy to Inside Information about the Intel-Altera Transaction.\u00a0 On several occasions during this time period, Partner-1 obtained confidential information about the contemplated transaction via email.\u00a0 For example, on January 29, 2015, Partner-1 received an email with deal terms, including the proposed price per share to purchase Altera.</p>\n<p>Between January 13, 2015, in the same month that Law Firm-1 was retained by Intel to advise on the Intel-Altera Transaction, and about February 10, 2015, the Defendants caused approximately 2.8 gigabytes of confidential data to be exfiltrated from the Law Firm-1 Email Server.</p>\n<p>Beginning February 17, 2015, during the time Law Firm-1 was advising Intel and after the Defendants had obtained access to confidential email data maintained at Law Firm-1, the Defendants used the Inside Information to purchase shares of Altera stock in the Trading Accounts.\u00a0 Prior to that date, none of the Trading Accounts had purchased any shares of Altera.</p>\n<p>To further effectuate their insider trading scheme, between February 17 and March 27, 2015, one or more of the Defendants used the Inside Information to purchase additional shares of Altera stock in the Trading Accounts on at least 26 occasions, ultimately purchasing more than 210,000 shares.</p>\n<p>On March 27, 2015, a financial newspaper published an article reporting on confidential merger discussions between Intel and Altera (the \u201cMarch 27 Newspaper Article\u201d).\u00a0 Following the publication of the article, on March 27, 2015, Altera\u2019s share price increased $9 per share, or approximately 26 percent, from Altera\u2019s share price on March 27, 2015, just prior to the March 27 Newspaper Article.\u00a0 On April 10 and April 13, 2015, the Defendants sold all of their shares of Altera stock for a profit of approximately $1.4 million.\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><u>The Law Firm-2 Hack and Insider Trading</u></strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>At all times relevant to this Indictment, Law Firm-2 was a U.S.-based international law firm with offices in New York, New York, which, among other services, provided advisory services to companies engaged in M&amp;A transactions.</p>\n<p><em>The Pitney Bowes-Borderfree Transaction</em></p>\n<p>In December 2014, Law Firm-2 was retained by Pitney Bowes Inc., a publicly traded international business services company, in connection with a contemplated acquisition of Borderfree, Inc., a publicly traded e-commerce company headquartered in New York, New York (the \u201cPitney Bowes-Borderfree Transaction\u201d).\u00a0 A partner in the M&amp;A group at Law Firm-2 (\u201cPartner-2\u201d) was an attorney who worked on the Pitney Bowes-Borderfree Transaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beginning about April 7, 2015, after Law Firm-2 had been retained to advise Pitney Bowes, the Defendants, without authorization, caused one of Law Firm-2\u2019s web servers (the \u201cLaw Firm-2 Web Server\u201d), located in New York, New York, to be accessed by using the unlawfully obtained credentials of a Law Firm-2 employee.\u00a0 The Defendants then caused malware to be installed on the Law Firm-2 Web Server.\u00a0 The malware on the Law Firm-2 Web Server allowed unauthorized access to at least one of Law Firm-2\u2019s email servers, also located in New York, New York (the \u201cLaw Firm-2 Email Server\u201d), which contained the emails of Law Firm-2 attorneys, including Partner-2.</p>\n<p>Between about April 8 and July 31, 2015, the Defendants then caused approximately seven gigabytes of confidential data to be exfiltrated from the Law Firm-2 Email Server over the course of at least six days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beginning April 29, 2015, hours after the Defendants had caused data from the Law Firm-2 Email Server to be exfiltrated, HONG and HUNG used the Inside Information to purchase shares of Borderfree stock for the Trading Accounts.\u00a0 Prior to that date, none of the Trading Accounts had purchased any shares of Borderfree stock.\u00a0 To further effectuate their insider trading scheme, between April 29 and May 5, 2015, HONG and HUNG used the Inside Information to purchase additional shares of Borderfree in the Trading Accounts on at least five occasions.\u00a0 In total, HONG and HUNG used the Inside Information to purchase 113,000 shares of Borderfree.</p>\n<p>On May 6, 2015, the Pitney Bowes-Borderfree Transaction became public.\u00a0 On that day, Borderfree\u2019s stock price increased by approximately $7 per share, or 105 percent, from the previous day\u2019s closing price.\u00a0 On May 18, 2015, HONG and HUNG sold their Borderfree shares, earning a profit of approximately $841,000.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Additional Insider Trading and Attempted Insider Trading Based on Inside Information Hacked from the Infiltrated Law Firms</u></strong></p>\n<p>In addition to trading on Inside Information in connection with the Contemplated Intermune Transaction, the Intel-Altera Transaction, and the Pitney Bowes-Borderfree Transaction, detailed above, the Defendants carried out their scheme to enrich themselves by obtaining and trading on the basis of Inside Information exfiltrated from the networks and servers of the Infiltrated Law Firms concerning at least 10 additional M&amp;A transactions, including certain M&amp;A transactions that were contemplated but never consummated.\u00a0 Several of these M&amp;A transactions involved Partner-1 or Partner-2.\u00a0 In total, as a result of trading on Inside Information, the Defendants enriched themselves by at least $4 million.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Attempts to Hack Other Victim Law Firms</u></strong></p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining and trading on Inside Information concerning M&amp;A transactions exfiltrated from the networks and servers of the Infiltrated Law Firms, the Defendants repeatedly attempted to cause unauthorized access to the networks and servers of five other Victim Law Firms using means and methods similar to those used to successfully access the Infiltrated Law Firms.\u00a0 For example, between March and September 2015, the Defendants attempted to cause unauthorized access to the networks and servers of these law firms on more than 100,000 occasions.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Robotics Company Intrusions</u></strong></p>\n<p>At certain relevant times, the Defendants were also involved in a start-up robotics company (the \u201cRobotics Company\u201d), started by ZHENG, the defendant, which was engaged in the business of developing robot controller chips and providing control system solutions.\u00a0 HONG and HUNG were also involved in running the Robotics Company.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between April 2014 and late 2015, in addition to their efforts to hack the Victim Law Firms\u2019 networks and servers during this period, the Defendants also caused confidential information to be exfiltrated from the networks and servers of two robotics companies (the \u201cRobotics Company Victims\u201d) using substantially similar means and methods of exfiltration as were used to access and attempt to access and exfiltrate information from the Victim Law Firms.\u00a0 Specifically, certain of the same servers that were used to carry out the hacks and attempted hacks of the Victim Law Firms were used to carry out hacks of the Robotics Company Victims. \u00a0Among other confidential information, the Defendants obtained confidential and proprietary information concerning the technology and design of consumer robotic products, including detailed and confidential proprietary design schematics. \u00a0Following these exfiltrations from the Robotics Company Victims, the Defendants exchanged emails containing certain of the confidential information they had caused to be exfiltrated from the Robotics Company Victims, including the proprietary schematics.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><u>Defendants and Charges</u></strong></p>\n<p>HONG, 26, and HUNG, 50, are residents of Macau.\u00a0 ZHENG, 30, is a resident of Changsha, China.\u00a0 HONG was arrested on December 25, 2016, in Hong Kong and is now pending extradition proceedings.\u00a0 The defendants are charged with the following offenses, which carry the maximum

Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Carole S. Rendon of the Northern District of Ohio and Special Agent in Charge Stephen D. Anthony of the FBI\u2019s Cleveland Division made the announcement.</p>\n<p>Bogdan Nicolescu, 34, Tiberiu Danet, 31, and Radu Miclaus, 34, were extradited to the United States this week after being taken into custody in their native Romania earlier this year.\u00a0 They were each charged with 12 counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis case illustrates the sophistication and determination with which cyber criminals seek to harm Americans and American businesses from abroad,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.\u00a0 \u201cBut our response demonstrates that, with effective international cooperation, we can track these criminals down and make sure they face justice, no matter where or how they try to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese defendants stole millions of dollars from people in the United States through a sophisticated fraud conspiracy they operated in Eastern Europe,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Rendon.\u00a0 \u201cCybercrime is an ever-growing threat.\u00a0 We will continue to work with both our partners in law enforcement and in the private sector to evolve with the threat and protect our networks and national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis indictment and subsequent arrests reveal the dynamic landscape in which international criminals utilize sophisticated cyber methods to take advantage of and defraud unsuspecting victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Anthony.\u00a0 \u201cDespite the complexity and global character of these investigations, these arrests demonstrate the commitment by the FBI and our partners to aggressively pursue these individuals and bring justice to the victims.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Nicolescu, Danet and Miclaus collectively operated a criminal conspiracy from Bucharest, Romania, which began at least as early 2007 with the development of proprietary malware used to infect and control more than 60,000 computers, primarily in the United States.\u00a0 The co-conspirators allegedly used the computers to harvest personally identifiable information, such as credit card information, user names and passwords; disable malware protection; and solve complex algorithms to accrue valuable cryptocurrency for the financial benefit of the group, a process known as cryptocurrency mining.</p>\n<p>To spread their malware, the defendants allegedly activated files that forced infected computers to register a total of over 100,000 email accounts with public email providers, according to the indictment.\u00a0 The co-conspirators sent a total of more than 11 million emails containing the malware from these accounts to email contacts copied from victim computers.\u00a0 When victims with infected computers visited websites such as Facebook, PayPal or eBay, the co-conspirators would redirect the computers to a nearly identical website they had created to steal account credentials.\u00a0 The defendants then used stolen credit card information to fund their criminal infrastructure while concealing their identities.</p>\n<p>In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants placed more than 1,000 fraudulent listings for automobiles, motorcycles and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction websites.\u00a0 Photos of the items were allegedly infected with malware, which, when clicked, redirected victims to fictitious webpages designed by the co-conspirators to resemble legitimate eBay pages.\u00a0 The fictitious webpages prompted users to pay for their goods through a nonexistent \u201ceBay Escrow Agent,\u201d and payments would then be funneled back to the co-conspirators.\u00a0 This scheme allegedly resulted in at least $4 million \u2013 though the actual total may be tens of millions more \u2013 in losses to victims, which the defendants laundered through wire transfers under the names of fictitious companies and then collected and delivered to the co-conspirators by \u201cmoney mules.\u201d</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The FBI investigated the case with assistance from the Romanian National Police.\u00a0 Senior Counsel Brian Levine of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Duncan T. Brown and Om Kakani of the Northern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.\u00a0 The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter.</p></div>",

tolerated,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. \u00a0\u201cThe Department of Justice\u2019s action today demonstrates that we will act to protect the integrity of judicial proceedings against attorneys and others who would seek to use them as a mechanism for their own illegal gains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe defendants in this case are charged with devising a scheme that casts doubt on the integrity of our profession,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Luger. \u201cThe conduct of these defendants was outrageous \u2013 they used deceptive lawsuits and unsuspecting judges to extort millions from vulnerable defendants. \u00a0Our courts are halls of justice where fairness and the rule of law triumph, and my office will use every available resource to stop corrupt lawyers from abusing our system of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe charges announced today describe a fraud scheme perpetrated by lawyers and officers of the court who abused their positions of trust for personal enrichment,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Thornton. \u00a0\u201cThe FBI remains committed to uncovering fraud such as this to protect the integrity of our civil justice system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe role of IRS Criminal Investigation becomes even more important in complex financial investigations involving money laundering because of the time it takes to unravel the criminal scheme,\u201d said Chief Weber. \u00a0\u201cThis case is an excellent example of the lengths to which individuals will go to defraud others in whatever way they can. \u00a0We are committed to working these types of difficult financial investigations and following the criminal\u2019s money, wherever it leads.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, between 2011 and 2014, Hansmeier and Steele, both practicing lawyers, executed a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $6 million by threatening copyright lawsuits against individuals who supposedly downloaded pornographic movies from file-sharing websites. \u00a0Hansmeier and Steele allegedly created a series of sham entities to obtain copyrights to pornographic movies that they uploaded to file-sharing websites and filed bogus copyright infringement lawsuits in order to learn the subscriber information associated with the IP addresses used to download the pornographic movies. \u00a0The indictment further alleges the defendants used extortionate letters and phone calls to threaten victims with enormous financial penalties and public embarrassment unless they agreed to pay a $4,000 settlement fee. \u00a0To distance themselves from the specious lawsuits and any potential fallout, defendants created and used Prenda Law, among other firms, to pursue their claims. \u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the charges, after various courts began to restrict the defendants\u2019 ability to sue multiple individuals in the same copyright lawsuit, the defendants changed their tactics and began filing lawsuits falsely alleging that computer systems belonging to their sham clients had been hacked. \u00a0To facilitate their phony \u201chacking\u201d lawsuits, Hansmeier and Steele allegedly recruited \u201cruse defendants,\u201d who had been caught downloading pornography from a file-sharing website, to be sued in exchange for Hansmeier and Steele waiving their settlement fees while pursuing claims against their supposed \u201cco-conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p>As alleged in the indictment, as courts began to uncover the defendant\u2019s unscrupulous litigation tactics, judges began denying the defendants\u2019 requests to subpoena ISPs, dismissing lawsuits, accusing the defendants of deceptive and fraudulent behavior and imposing sanctions against the defendants and their associates. \u00a0For example, on May 6, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued an order imposing sanctions against the defendants. \u00a0In total, the defendants obtained approximately $6 million from the fraudulent copyright lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>\n<p>FBI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. \u00a0Senior Trial Counsel Brian Levine of the Department of Justice\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Langner of the District of Minnesota are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n<div>\n<div><a

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Jeffrey Wilson and Craig Ducey were sentenced to serve prison terms of 120 months and 74 months, respectively, for their roles in multi-million dollar fraud schemes involving: biodiesel tax credits, renewable fuel credits and shares of Imperial Petroleum Inc., announced Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Department of Justice\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division and U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler for the Southern District of Indiana. Yesterday, Chad Ducey was sentenced to an 84-month prison term for his role in the same schemes. \u00a0These defendants were the last to be sentenced from a gaggle of seven charged co-conspirators. \u00a0The others, Joseph Furando, Katirina Tracy, Brian Carmichael and Chris Ducey were sentenced at prior hearings. \u00a0Although charged in three separate cases, all the defendants were involved in fraud involving federal incentives to produce renewable fuels, specifically biodiesel.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s sentences were the first to address securities fraud charges leveled against Wilson and Craig Ducey. \u00a0That fraud stemmed from lies those defendants told in the course of their dealings with investors, auditors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, while representing Imperial Petroleum. \u00a0Wilson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Imperial Petroleum, was the person who drafted and certified the accuracy of Imperial\u2019s quarterly and annual reports and made those reports available to the investing public through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \u00a0He also lied to the company\u2019s outside auditor to keep him from learning of the scheme. \u00a0At a jury trial in July 2016, he was convicted for his role in the fraud. \u00a0In April 2015, Craig Ducey admitted to related crimes and began cooperating with the United States; he testified at Wilson\u2019s at trial and the court recognized his substantial assistance in giving him a lower sentence than Wilson.</p>\n<p>\"Biodiesel has the potential to make the nation\u2019s transportation sector more sustainable, while decreasing our dependence on foreign energy sources, but only if done right,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Cruden. \u00a0\u201cThe defendants\u2019 fraud in these cases not only cheated customers, investors and taxpayers, it set renewable fuel efforts back for the entire nation. \u00a0At a time when Americans should have been working together to have clean, sustainable and safe energy, the defendants chose to line their own pockets. \u00a0Prison is the appropriate consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing is the final chapter in a complex scheme involving phony renewable fuel credits,\u201d said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.\u00a0 \u201cThe Renewable Fuel Standard is designed to reduce greenhouse gases, fight climate change and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\u00a0 EPA and its partners are committed to protecting the integrity of this important program and to ensuring a level playing field for honest companies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndiana is not the place to try to fool the investing public,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Minkler, \u201cHere, we expect executives to care about shareholders and to be upfront and honest about what the companies they manage are doing. \u00a0Today, Jeffrey Wilson and Craig Ducey learned where the other path, the path of deceit, leads.\u201d</p>\n<p>As shown at Wilson\u2019s trial, the securities fraud began when Wilson learned that e-biofuels LLC\u2014a business that Wilson arranged for Imperial Petroleum to buy\u2014was faking paperwork to claim incentives for biodiesel it had not manufactured. \u00a0Put another way, Wilson learned that the e-biofuels managers fraudulently claimed millions in federal tax rebates and other incentives that had no basis in real manufacturing. Knowing that it was much more profitable for e-biofuels to fraudulently claim government incentives on biodiesel that had been made by somebody else, Wilson directed the e\u2011biofuels managers to move more and more gallons of such fuel rather than incur the cost associated with legitimate biodiesel production. \u00a0Despite their knowledge that the e-biofuels facility was dormant, Wilson and Craig Ducey told investors, auditors and SEC that it made millions of gallons a month from raw materials like chicken fat. \u00a0This defrauded biodiesel buyers\u2014who were duped into taking bad tax credits and renewable fuel credits\u2014and also defrauded investors, who would never have invested in Imperial Petroleum had they known its profits were based on sham manufacturing.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Chad Ducey was sentenced for his role in the underlying wire, tax fraud and environmental crime that were hidden by the securities fraud (he was not charged with securities fraud). \u00a0Chad Ducey owned e-biofuels, together with his brother Craig Ducey, until they sold it to Imperial Petroleum in a deal that Wilson organized. \u00a0Chad Ducey was intimately familiar with how the e-biofuels facility worked and knew that it was not manufacturing biodiesel between July 2010 and June 2011. \u00a0Nevertheless, he twice persuaded an outside engineer that the facility was a biodiesel producer as essential steps to registering and claiming renewable fuel incentives.</p>\n<p>In addition, as shown during Wilson\u2019s trial, Chad Ducey worked with Wilson and others to try to establish \u201cbeachheads\u201d in Texas. \u00a0A beachhead would have been a fuel transload facility used to disguise the transfer of biodiesel to an e-biofuels customer from a Texas fuel terminal where it was purchased. \u00a0Essentially, a brief stop at the beachhead would have stood in for actual biodiesel production. Chad Ducey traveled to Texas in order to scout sites for the transload facility. \u00a0Workers at e-biofuels called these remote, no-production transfers \u201cghost loads\u201d and the transload facility was planned to hide those loads. \u00a0Ghost loads occurred in Texas and between fuel terminals and e-biofuels customers in Illinois, Indiana and Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing represents the culmination of a five-year investigation of the largest tax and securities fraud scheme in Indiana history,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge W. Jay Abbott of the Indianapolis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI collaborated with our partner agencies from the beginning to uncover the significant and widespread fraudulent activity. \u00a0The complexity and magnitude of this scheme required extensive forensic accounting and computer forensic work.\u00a0 The FBI will continue to thoroughly investigate individuals that commit illegal acts by stealing money from individuals, businesses, and government programs.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cImperial Petroleum\u2019s top executive played a key role in this massive scheme to deceive investors,\u201d said Regional Director David Glockner of the SEC Chicago Regional Office. \u00a0\u201cThe SEC was pleased to participate in a multi-agency effort to hold him accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sentencings handed down send a loud message that IRS Criminal Investigation operates year round to protect the integrity of our tax system and today is a victory for the American people\u201d said Special Agent in Charge James Robnett for the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). \u00a0\u201cThe object of the defendant\u2019s schemes was to defraud the government, the IRS and the taxpaying public.\u00a0 IRS-CI together with the cooperative efforts of our law enforcement partners, identified and vigorously investigated and put a stop to the fraud and those involved in this scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p>The wire fraud, tax fraud, securities fraud and environmental crime investigation that culminated in this week\u2019s sentencing hearings began in January 2012, when investigators from the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, IRS-CI and the SEC began meeting with a whistleblower whose statements were corroborated by government agency data. \u00a0That led the investigative team to conclude that e-biofuels had engaged in sham manufacturing and tax fraud. \u00a0Based on intense work at the beginning of the investigation, the team obtained a multi-state search warrant in May 2012, which yielded substantial additional evidence and witness accounts. \u00a0For over a year, prosecutors and attorneys from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, the Environmental Crimes Section of the Department of Justice and SEC pursued the investigation of this matter with special agents of the FBI, EPA, and IRS. \u00a0Their work involved nearly 100 witness interviews and the review of millions of documents.</p>\n<p>The United States approached targets of the investigation and sought pre-indictment plea agreements with them. \u00a0Ultimately, one defendant, Brian Carmichael, entered into a plea agreement before indictment. \u00a0The others were indicted in September of 2013. \u00a0After multiple continuances sought by the defendants and one additional plea, the first case, involving tax fraud, wire fraud and false statements under the Clean Air Act, was set for a final trial date of May 2015. \u00a0Ultimately, all of the defendants in that case pleaded guilty before trial. \u00a0The second case, which was the case against Jeffrey Wilson for securities fraud, was scheduled for trial and then continued at the defendant\u2019s request. \u00a0It was continued and ultimately set for a final trial date of July 2016. \u00a0In a two-week trial, the United States presented evidence that Wilson had lied to investors in person, through filings he created for his publicly traded company and indirectly through company auditors. \u00a0Wilson was convicted of fraud in the offer and sale of securities, falsely certifying annual and quarterly reports filed with SEC, lying to a public company\u2019s outside auditor and making false statements to investigators. Today\u2019s sentencing hearing establishes Wilson\u2019s punishment for those convictions.</p>\n<p>According to Senior Litigation Counsel Steven Debrota, Thomas Ballentine, Assistant Section Chief of the Environmental Crimes Section of the department\u2019s and Jake Schmidt, SEC Senior Attorney, who prosecuted this case for the government, Wilson must pay $16 million in restitution.</p></div>",

Nila</b>, the founder of Blue Courage.</p>\n<p>Nila is honored for his significant contributions to state and local law enforcement and communities nationwide.\u00a0 During his law enforcement career, he recognized a significant gap between what we want our country\u2019s police officers to be and how the law enforcement profession is currently educating its personnel.\u00a0 To address this gap, Nila developed Blue Courage, a blend of education, principles, practices, skills and tools that foster a culture of leadership, character and service.\u00a0 Blue Courage focuses on the heart and mind which represents the foundation to making good decisions and enhancing the capacity to serve honorably.\u00a0 Today, over 10,000 officers have been trained in Blue Courage and its principles are now infused in recruiting and police academy curricula in four states, with an additional 10 states competing to go through the process.\u00a0 As a direct result of Blue Courage training, officers are more in tune with and aware of their thoughts and behaviors.\u00a0 Furthermore, they have tools to become centered and balanced, and are reminded of why they joined the law enforcement profession.\u00a0 Through Blue Courage, Nila has demonstrated he is a committed and effective partner in the department\u2019s efforts to inspire and engage our nation\u2019s state and local law enforcement officers, and to strengthen relationships with communities nationwide.</p>\n<p>The <b>Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity </b>is presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor, dean and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department.\u00a0 This year\u2019s award is presented to <b>Lee J. Lofthus</b>, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.</p>\n<p>Lofthus exemplifies the very best in executive leadership and has demonstrated three decades of dedication to public service which have resulted in outstanding organizational achievements.\u00a0 As the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Senior Management Official, he provides effective leadership, directing diverse and complicated financial and budgetary programs, human resources, procurement, facilities, security and information technology activities.\u00a0 His career in public service has been distinguished by an unfaltering dedication to lead, motivate and inspire people.\u00a0 His vision, adaptability and commitment to customer service enable him to direct organizations through many complex endeavors and times of uncertainty.\u00a0 He has transformed the department\u2019s administrative processes through innovative technologies and the recruitment and retention of talented and diverse leadership.\u00a0 On the financial side, since 2004, Lofthus accomplished a rare feat in that he was able to get clean audits for the department for 12 straight years and for nine straight years, the auditor\u2019s report on internal control identified no material weaknesses at the consolidated level.\u00a0 Lofthus has played a central role in developing budget strategies in direct response to the initiatives of several Attorneys General in the areas of counterterrorism, national security and the administration of justice.\u00a0 He has provided unmatched leadership in initiatives to provide funding to state and local law enforcement entities throughout the department.\u00a0 Lofthus is well-known and respected in a variety of public and private arenas, and he is commonly sought out to advise and speak on a variety of challenging government-wide financial and budgetary-based initiatives.</p>\n<p>The <b>Attorney General\u2019s Award for Distinguished Service</b> is the Justice Department\u2019s second-highest award for employee performance.\u00a0 The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the department\u2019s mission.\u00a0 Seventeen Distinguished Service Awards are presented this year to individuals or teams of people.</p>\n<p>The first Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 (ATF\u2019s) Violent Crime Intelligence Division, Special Agents <b>Tolliver L. Hart</b> and <b>Clinton F. Kehr</b>, Intelligence Research Specialists <b>Lianne S. Binckes</b>, <b>Robert D. Blevins</b> and <b>Jenise Ramos</b>, Industry Operations Intelligence Specialists <b>Jill M. Hansen </b>and <b>Nicholas A. Speranza Jr.</b>, Intelligence Program Specialist <b>Daniel R. Mullins</b>, Information Technology Specialists <b>Laurie J. Powers</b> and <b>John E. Trice</b> and Management Analyst <b>Rhonda M. Butler</b>; and from ATF\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, Attorney <b>Ellen V. Endrizzi</b>.</p>\n<p>ATF\u2019s Internet Investigations Center (IIC) is recognized for its outstanding determination, perseverance and subject-matter expertise to support ATF\u2019s work to combat internet-based firearms crimes and related violations.\u00a0 The team, in conjunction with department guidance, drafted ATF\u2019s internet investigations policy and established numerous standard operating procedures for ATF\u2019s investigative and intelligence footprint online.\u00a0 The recipients also provided current, pertinent training to law enforcement audiences both inside and outside of ATF.\u00a0 Through the use of advanced technology, coupled with finely honed analytic and investigative skills, IIC personnel made its mark on illegal firearms transactions on all levels of the internet.\u00a0 This work was not only commended by partner law enforcement agencies, but the team was also recognized by an illicit Darknet vendor that named ATF specifically as one of the reasons it ceased illegal firearms transactions on its website.</p>\n<p>The second Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Litigation III Section, Section Chief <b>David C. Kully</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>William H. Jones II</b>, <b>John R. Read</b>, <b>Adam C. Speegle</b> and <b>Nathan P. Sutton</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Section Chief <b>Kristen C. Limarzi</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Shana M. Wallace</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Washington II Criminal Section, Trial Attorney <b>Daniel McCuaig</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Economic Regulatory Section, Assistant Section Chief <b>Jeffrey M. Wilder</b> and Economist <b>Alexander Raskovich</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Economic Litigation Section, Economists <b>William T. Whalen</b> and <b>Tor Winston</b>; from the Antitrust Division Litigation II Section, Assistant Section Chief <b>Stephanie A. Fleming</b>; and from the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Trial Attorney <b>Finnuala K. Tessier</b>.</p>\n<p>The Antitrust Division\u2019s victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages.\u00a0 The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apple\u2019s appeal.\u00a0 In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent.\u00a0 The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government.\u00a0 However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apple\u2019s petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit\u2019s decision affirming Judge Cote\u2019s order.\u00a0 The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial court\u2019s and Second Circuit\u2019s decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division\u2019s New York Office, Section Chief <b>Jeffrey D. Martino</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>Bryan C. Bughman</b>, <b>Joseph Muoio Jr.</b> and <b>Carrie A. Syme</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Chicago Office, Trial Attorney <b>Eric L. Schleef</b>; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Washington Criminal I Section, Trial Attorney <b>George S. Baranko</b>; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section, Principal Deputy Chief <b>Sandra L. Moser</b>, Deputy Chief <b>Benjamin Singer</b> and former Deputy Chief <b>Daniel A. Braun</b>, Assistant Chief <b>Albert B. Stieglitz Jr.</b> and Trial Attorneys <b>Melissa Aoyagi</b> and <b>Gary A. Winters</b>; and from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special Agents <b>Jennifer Riker</b> and <b>Jeffrey Weeks</b> and Forensic Accountant <b>Kyle D. Dornbos</b>.</p>\n<p>The recipients, through their leadership, dedication and tireless investigation of price fixing and bid rigging, are responsible for the historic prosecution of five of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions that agreed to pay fines in excess of $2.7 billion.\u00a0 The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate.\u00a0 These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day.\u00a0 The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.</p>\n<p>The fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor General <b>Eric J. Feigin</b>; from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Chief <b>Diana K. Flynn</b>, Principal Deputy Chief <b>Sharon M. McGowan</b> and Trial Attorney <b>Robert A. Koch</b>; and from the Civil Division\u2019s Appellate Staff, Director <b>Douglas N. Letter</b> and Attorneys <b>Jeffrey E. Sandberg</b> and <b>Abby C. Wright</b>.</p>\n<p>In Obergefell v. Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage.\u00a0 In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administration\u2019s strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case.\u00a0 Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue.\u00a0 The brief reiterated the department\u2019s US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families.\u00a0 In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy Chief <b>Matthew R. Stiglitz</b>, Special Counsel <b>Stacey Luck</b> and Paralegal Specialist <b>Linda Faulk</b>; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Associate Director <b>Magdalena Boynton</b>; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Division, Judicial Attach\u00e9 <b>Marlon Cobar</b>; from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. Attorney <b>Michael P. Ben\u2019Ary</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Miami Field Office, Special Agent <b>Charles M. Bryden</b> and Supervisory Intelligence Analyst <b>Raquel de la Huerta</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Rodney Cortes</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division, Unit Chief <b>Edgar Cruz</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Legal Attach\u00e9 Santo Domingo, Supervisory Special Agent <b>N.I. Delgado Jr.</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Legal Attach\u00e9 Bogota, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Andres E. Quintero</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special Agent <b>Beau Bourgeois</b>; and from the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Special Agent <b>Suhaib Karim Qureshi</b>.</p>\n<p>On June 20, 2013, DEA Special Agent James Terry Watson was stabbed to death during an attempted kidnapping and robbery perpetrated by an organized group of taxi drivers in Bogota.\u00a0 A team of investigators and prosecutors was assembled, and working with their Colombian counterparts, they quickly identified seven individuals responsible for the murder and subsequent destruction of evidence.\u00a0 In an example of teamwork and coordination at its best, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants were obtained for the suspects within four days of the crime; within 18 months, the defendants\u2019 extraditions were secured and they were all convicted.\u00a0 Because of the diligent work of those assigned to the case, justice was served for the family of Special Agent Watson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sixth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Chief <b>Steven J. Grocki</b> and Deputy Chief <b>Keith A.

Michael Gordon</b> and Intelligence Analyst <b>Robert Plumb</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Steven A. Smith Jr.</b>; from the FBI\u2019s Critical Incident Response Group, Supervisory Special Agent <b>Daniel E. O\u2019Donnell</b>; and from the FBI\u2019s Omaha Field Office, Special Agents <b>Sara K. Stanley</b> and <b>Jeffrey D. Tarpinian</b>.</p>\n<p>The recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Torpedo, a precedent-setting investigation that used first-of-its-kind techniques to infiltrate the dark internet and identify individuals who, under the perceived cloak of anonymity, secretly congregated to trade images of children being sexually abused and to celebrate the sexual abuse of children.\u00a0 By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network.\u00a0 The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments.\u00a0 Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn.\u00a0 The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated.\u00a0 It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.</p>\n<p>The seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy Chief <b>Franz R. Marshall</b> of the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section.\u00a0 Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country.\u00a0 Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0 Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students.\u00a0 He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou.\u00a0 In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v. Board of Education.</p>\n<p>The eighth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Environmental Enforcement Section, Section Chief <b>Thomas A.

Spiro</b>.</p>\n<p>To redress the BP/Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, this team successfully pursued the companies responsible for this multimillion-barrel oil spill.\u00a0 The recipients resolved the nation\u2019s civil claims against those companies for more than $6.6 billion in civil penalties; more than $8 billion in natural resource damages; hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, assessment and other costs; and injunctive relief that should make for safer drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\u00a0 Under applicable law, the majority of these funds will fuel restoration of natural resources and some economic redevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico region.\u00a0 The matter is the department\u2019s largest-ever environmental enforcement effort.\u00a0 The team\u2019s work also made it possible for the five Gulf states and their local governments to settle their economic damage claims for sums approaching another $5.9 billion.</p>\n<p>The ninth Distinguished Service Award is presented to Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>Michelle B. Alvarez</b>,<b> Jeffrey N. Kaplan</b>,<b> Lawrence D. LaVecchio</b>, <b>Alison W. Lehr</b>,<b> Paul F. Schwartz</b>,<b> Evelyn B. Sheehan </b>and <b>Madeleine Shirley </b>of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.</p>\n<p>In October 2009, it was discovered that attorney Scott Rothstein was conducting one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history through the operation of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt &amp; Adler P.A. (RRA).\u00a0 The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases.\u00a0 Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRA\u2019s ability to attract new investors.\u00a0 During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations.\u00a0 Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.</p>\n<p>The 10<sup>th</sup> Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. Attorneys <b>John P.

Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cAnd CCIPS has been performing that role for 20 years, long before terms like \u2018data breach\u2019 or the \u2018darknet\u2019 became common references.\u201d</p>\n<p>CCIPS was established on Oct. 13, 1996, from an earlier five-attorney \u201cComputer Crime Unit\u201d formed in 1991 within the division\u2019s General Litigation and Legal Advice Section.\u00a0 In 20 years, CCIPS\u2019s membership has grown to more than 40 attorneys, in addition to nine digital investigative analysts who comprise the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab.\u00a0 Section attorneys regularly run complex investigations; resolve unique legal and investigative issues raised by emerging computer and telecommunications technologies; litigate cases; provide litigation support to other prosecutors; train federal, state and local law enforcement personnel; comment on and propose legislation; promote cybersecurity; and initiate and participate in international efforts to combat computer and intellectual property crime.</p>\n<p>Since 1996, the section has prosecuted cases involving hundreds of millions of pieces of stolen information, including credit card and debit card numbers, email addresses, social security numbers and other personally identifying information; hundreds of millions of dollars of trade secrets, including highly sensitive technologies and agricultural products; tens of millions of counterfeit products and copyrighted works, ranging from pharmaceutical products and military supplies to digital media; and millions of compromised computers victimized by botnets and ransomware.</p>\n<p>CCIPS\u2019s litigation accomplishments, in partnership with prosecutors in U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country, include prosecutions of sophisticated hackers, such as the conviction of hacker <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-hacking-ring-sentenced-massive-identity-thefts-payment-processor-and-us-retail\">Albert Gonzalez</a> who, along with co-conspirators, infiltrated the computer networks of major retailers around the country and stole in excess of 40 million credit/debit card numbers; the disruption of the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-leads-multi-national-action-against-gameover-zeus-botnet-and-cryptolocker-ransomware\">Gameover Zeus botnet and Cryptolocker ransomware scheme</a> in connection with the indictment of Russian alleged cybercriminal Evgeniy Bogachev;

Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Emily Rice of the District of New Hampshire and Resident Agent in Charge Holly Fraumeni of the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Manchester, New Hampshire, Field Office made the announcement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ryan J. Vallee, 22, formerly of Belmont and Franklin, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to a 31-count superseding indictment charging him with 13 counts of making interstate threats, one count of computer hacking to steal information, eight counts of computer hacking to extort, eight counts of aggravated identity theft and one count of cyberstalking.\u00a0 On March 16, 2016, while Vallee was awaiting trial, he was re-arrested on new criminal charges and has remained in custody since then.\u00a0 He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1, 2016, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire</p>\n<p>According to admissions made in connection with his plea, from 2011 through March 2016, Vallee, using various aliases that included \u201cSeth Williams\u201d and \u201cJames McRow,\u201d engaged in a computer hacking and \u201csextortion\u201d campaign designed to force numerous victims to provide him with sexually explicit photographs of themselves and others.</p>\n<p>Vallee admitted that he employed a variety of techniques to force his victims to cede to his \u201csextortionate\u201d demands.\u00a0 For example, according to the plea agreement, he repeatedly hacked into and took control over the victims\u2019 online accounts, including their email, Facebook and Instagram accounts.\u00a0 Once he had control of these accounts, Vallee locked the victims out of their own accounts and, in some cases, defaced the contents of the accounts, he admitted.\u00a0 According to the plea, in at least one instance, Vallee hacked into a victim\u2019s Amazon.com account, which stored her payment information and shipping address, then ordered items of a sexual nature and had them shipped to the victim\u2019s home.\u00a0 Vallee also admitted that in some instances, he obtained sexually explicit photos of the victims and their friends and distributed them to the victims, their friends and their family members.\u00a0 With at least one victim, Vallee created a Facebook page using an account name that was virtually identical to the victim\u2019s real Facebook account name, with one letter misspelled, he admitted.\u00a0 He then posted sexually explicit photos of the victim on this fake Facebook page and issued \u201cfriend requests\u201d to the victim, her friends and her family members, according to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p>Vallee admitted that he repeatedly sent threatening electronic communications to his victims, usually by using spoofing or anonymizing text message services, in which he threatened his victims that unless they gave him sexually explicit photographs of themselves, he would continue with the above-described conduct.\u00a0 According to the admissions in the plea agreement, when most of the victims refused to comply with Vallee\u2019s demands and begged him to leave them alone, Vallee responded with threats to inflict additional harm.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Secret Service investigated the case with substantial assistance from the Belmont Police Department.\u00a0 Senior Trial Attorney Mona Sedky of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Arnold H. Huftalen of the District of New Hampshire are prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p>Victims of \u201csextortion\u201d schemes such as this often may be hesitant to come forward.\u00a0 The Justice Department encourages individuals who may be the victims of similar schemes to contact their local law enforcement agencies to report this conduct.</p></div>",

Carlin and U.S. Attorney Eileen M. Decker of the Central District of California.</p>\n<p>\u201cSu Bin\u2019s sentence is a just punishment for his admitted role in a conspiracy with hackers from the People's Liberation Army Air Force to illegally access and steal sensitive U.S. military information,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cSu assisted the Chinese military hackers in their efforts to illegally access and steal designs for cutting-edge military aircraft that are indispensable to our national defense. \u00a0These activities have serious consequences for the national security of our country and the safety of the men and women of our armed services. \u00a0This prison sentence reinforces our commitment to ensure that hackers, regardless of state affiliation, are held accountable for their criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProtecting our national security interests, including sensitive military information, is the Justice Department\u2019s highest priority,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Decker.\u00a0 \u201cOver the course of years, this defendant sought to undermine the national security of the United States by seeking out information that would benefit a foreign government and providing that country with information it had never before seen.\u00a0 The outstanding efforts of the prosecutors and investigators who developed this case demonstrate our commitment to protecting our nation\u2019s security from all threats.\u00a0 As this case shows, criminals can be held accountable no matter where they are located in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Su Bin, who is also known as Stephen Su and Stephen Subin, 51, a citizen and resident of the People\u2019s Republic of China, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder of the Central District of California.</p>\n<p>Su told his co-conspirators \u2013 military officers in China \u2013 whom to target, which files to steal and why the information they stole was significant.\u00a0 During the course of the conspiracy, Su and his co-conspirators stole sensitive military and export-controlled data and sent the stolen information to China.</p>\n<p>On March 23, Su pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and to violate the Arms Export Control Act by exporting defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List contained in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\u00a0 Su admitted that he conspired with two persons in China from October 2008 to March 2014 to gain unauthorized access to protected computer networks in the United States \u2013 including computers belonging to the Boeing Company in Orange County, California \u2013 to obtain sensitive military information and to export that information illegally from the United States to China.</p>\n<p>A criminal complaint filed in 2014 and subsequent indictments filed in Los Angeles charged Su, a China-based businessman in the aviation and aerospace fields, for his role in the criminal conspiracy to steal military technical data, including data relating to the C-17 strategic transport aircraft and certain fighter jets produced for the U.S. military. Su was initially arrested in Canada in July 2014 on a warrant issued in relation to this case. Su ultimately waived extradition and consented to be conveyed to the United States in February 2016.</p>\n<p>Su admitted that as part of the conspiracy, he sent e-mails to his co-conspirators with guidance regarding what persons, companies and technologies to target during their computer intrusions. One of Su\u2019s co-conspirators gained access to information located on computers of U.S. companies, and he emailed Su directory file listings and folders showing the data that the co-conspirator had been able to access. Su then directed his co-conspirator as to which files and folders his co-conspirator should steal. Once the co-conspirator stole the data, using techniques to avoid detection when hacking the victim computers, Su translated the contents of certain stolen data from English into Chinese. In addition, acoording to Su's admissions and the sentencing documents, Su and his co-conspirators each wrote, revised and emailed reports addressed to the Second Department, General Staff Headquarters, Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army about the information and technology they had acquired by their hacking activities, including its value, to the final beneficiaries of their hacking activities. Su also admitted that he engaged in the crime for the purpose of financial gain and specifically sought to profit from selling the data the he and his conspirators illegally acquired.</p>\n<p>The case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office\u2019s Cyber Division with assistance from the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\u00a0 This case was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California\u2019s Terrorism and Export Crimes Section and Trial Attorney Casey Arrowood and Senior Trial Attorney Robert E. Wallace of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, with support from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p></div>",

Carlin and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>Xu was initially arrested by the FBI on Dec. 7, 2015, and was previously charged with one count of theft of trade secrets.\u00a0 Xu is scheduled to be arraigned on the superseding indictment at 12 p.m. EDT on June 16, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Kenneth M.

Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cThose who steal America\u2019s trade secrets for the benefit of foreign nations pose a threat to our economic and national security interests. \u00a0The National Security Division will continue to work tirelessly to identify, pursue and prosecute any individual who attempts to harm American businesses by robbing them of their valuable intellectual property.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs alleged, Xu Jiaqiang is charged with stealing valuable, proprietary software from his former employer, an American company, that he intended to share with an agency within the Chinese government,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Bharara.\u00a0 \u201cEconomic espionage not only harms victim companies that have years or even decades of work stolen, but it also crushes the spirit of innovation and fair play in the global economy.\u00a0 Economic espionage is a serious federal crime, for which my office, the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, and the FBI will show no tolerance.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint on which Xu was initially arrested, the original indictment and the superseding indictment:</p>\n<p>From November 2010 to May 2014, Xu worked as a developer for a particular U.S. company (victim company).\u00a0 As a developer, Xu had access to certain proprietary software, as well as that software\u2019s underlying source code.\u00a0 The proprietary software is a clustered file system developed and marketed by the victim company in the United States and other countries.\u00a0 A clustered file system facilitates faster computer performance by coordinating work among multiple servers.\u00a0 The victim company takes significant precautions to protect the proprietary source code as a trade secret because the value of the proprietary source code depends in part on its secrecy.\u00a0 Among other things, the proprietary source code is stored behind a company firewall and can be accessed by only a small subset of the victim company\u2019s employees.\u00a0 Before receiving proprietary source code access, victim company employees must first request and receive approval from a particular victim company official.\u00a0 Victim company employees must also agree in writing at both the outset and the conclusion of their employment that they will maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In May 2014, Xu voluntarily resigned from the victim company.\u00a0 Xu subsequently communicated with one undercover law enforcement officer (UC-1), who posed as a financial investor aiming to start a large-data storage technology company, and another undercover law enforcement officer (UC-2), who posed as a project manager working for UC-1.\u00a0 In these communications, Xu discussed his past work with the victim company and indicated that he had experience with the proprietary software and the proprietary source code.\u00a0 On March 6, 2015, Xu sent UC-1 and UC-2 a code, which Xu stated was a sample of Xu\u2019s prior work with the victim company.\u00a0 A victim company employee (employee-1) later confirmed that the code sent by Xu included proprietary victim company material that related to the proprietary source code.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Xu subsequently informed UC-2 that he was willing to consider providing UC-2\u2019s company with the proprietary source code as a platform for UC-2\u2019s company to facilitate the development of UC-2\u2019s company\u2019s own data storage system.\u00a0 Xu informed UC-2 that if UC-2 set up several computers as a small network, then Xu would remotely install the proprietary software so that UC-1 and UC-2 could test it and confirm its functionality.</p>\n<p>In or around early August 2015, the FBI arranged for a computer network to be set up, consistent with Xu\u2019s specifications (UC network).\u00a0 Files were then remotely uploaded to the FBI-arranged computer network.\u00a0 Thereafter, on or about Aug. 26, 2015, Xu and UC-2 confirmed that UC-2 had received the upload.\u00a0 In September 2015, the FBI made Xu\u2019s upload available to a victim company employee who has expertise regarding the proprietary software and the proprietary source code (employee-2).\u00a0 Based on employee-2\u2019s analysis of technical features of Xu\u2019s upload, it appeared to employee-2 that the upload contained a functioning copy of the proprietary software.\u00a0 It further appeared to employee-2 that Xu\u2019s upload had been built by someone with access to the proprietary source code that was not working within the victim company or otherwise at the victim company\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-2 at a hotel in White Plains, New York.\u00a0 Xu stated, in sum and substance, that he had used the proprietary source code to make software to sell to customers, that he knew the proprietary source code was the product of decades of work on the part of the victim company and that he had used the proprietary source code to build a copy of the proprietary software, which he had uploaded and installed on the UC network.\u00a0 Xu also indicated that he knew that the copy of the proprietary software he had installed on the UC network contained information identifying the proprietary software as the victim company\u2019s property, which could reveal the fact that the proprietary software had been built with the proprietary source code without the victim company\u2019s authorization.\u00a0 Xu told UC-2 that he could take steps to prevent detection of the proprietary software\u2019s origins, including writing computer scripts that would modify the proprietary source code to conceal its origins.</p>\n<p>Later on Dec. 7, 2015, Xu met with UC-1 and UC-2 at the hotel.\u00a0 During that meeting, Xu showed UC-2 a copy of what he represented to be the proprietary source code on his laptop.\u00a0 Xu noted to UC-2 a portion of the code that indicated it originated with the victim company as well as the date on which it had been copyrighted.\u00a0 Xu also stated that he had previously modified the proprietary source code\u2019s command interface to conceal the fact that the proprietary source code originated with the victim company and identified multiple specific customers to whom he had previously provided the proprietary software using his stolen copy of the proprietary source code.</p>\n<p>In connection with the economic espionage counts charged in the superseding indictment, Xu stole, duplicated and possessed the proprietary source code with the intent to benefit the National Health and Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p>\n<p>The superseding indictment charges Xu with three counts of economic espionage, which each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. \u00a0He was also charged with three counts of theft of a trade secret, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.</p>\n<p>A superseding indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.\u00a0 Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty.</p>\n<p>The case is being investigated by the FBI, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Benjamin Allee and Ilan Graff of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p><img

Carlin, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sentence holds Minh Quang Pham accountable for his terrorist activities, including providing material support to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and receiving explosives training from Anwar al-Aulaqi in Yemen for the purpose of committing an attack in the United Kingdom,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cCounterterrorism is the National Security Division\u2019s highest priority, and we will continue to bring justice to those who seek to aid designated foreign terrorist organizations in their efforts to commit violent attacks against the United States and our allies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinh Quang Pham committed himself to the violent mission of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization that has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks around the world, including the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Bharara.\u00a0 \u201cPham went to Yemen to receive military training from AQAP and contributed to Inspire magazine, a recruitment tool and \u2018how-to\u2019 guide for would-be terrorists around the world.\u00a0 This prosecution and today\u2019s sentencing show that terrorists and those who support them will continue to be brought to justice in American courts, thanks to the continuing resolve of the Department of Justice, this Office and our global law enforcement partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Minh Pham traveled to Yemen, where he received military-style training from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including learning to build explosive devices, with the intent to commit harm against the United States and our allies,\" said <span>Assistant Director in Charge Abbate. \u00a0\"</span>Pham also contributed to terrorist propaganda in order to promote acts of violence and hate across the globe. \u00a0This sentence sends a strong message that the FBI and our law enforcement partners can and will track down dangerous terrorists anywhere in the world and return them to face justice for their crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, extradition materials, court filings and statements made at related court proceedings, including today\u2019s sentencing:</p>\n<p>In December 2010, after informing others that he planned to travel to Ireland, Pham traveled from London, where he resided, to Yemen, the principal base of operations for AQAP.\u00a0 Pham traveled to Yemen in order to join AQAP, to wage jihad on behalf of AQAP and to martyr himself for AQAP\u2019s cause.\u00a0 After arriving in Yemen, he swore an oath of loyalty to AQAP in the presence of an AQAP commander.</p>\n<p>While in Yemen in 2010 and 2011, Pham provided assistance to and received training from Anwar al-Aulaqi, a U.S.-born senior leader of AQAP.\u00a0 Al-Aulaqi advised Pham to return to the United Kingdom for the purpose of finding and making contact with individuals who, like Pham, wanted to travel to Yemen to join AQAP.\u00a0 Al-Aulaqi also provided Pham with money, as well as a telephone number and e-mail address that Pham was to use to contact al-Aulaqi upon his return to the United Kingdom.\u00a0 In addition, Pham exchanged his laptop computer with al-Aulaqi, who provided him with a new \u201cclean\u201d laptop to take with him when he returned to the United Kingdom so that the authorities would not find anything if they searched his computer.</p>\n<p>In or about June 2011, prior to his departure from Yemen, Pham approached al-Aulaqi about conducting a suicide attack whereby he would \u201csacrifice\u201d himself on behalf of AQAP.\u00a0 Al-Aulaqi personally taught Pham how to create a lethal explosive device using household chemicals and directed Pham to detonate such an explosive device at the arrivals area of London\u2019s Heathrow International Airport following Pham\u2019s return to the United Kingdom in 2011.\u00a0 Al-Aulaqi instructed Pham to carry an explosive in a concealed backpack and target the area where flights arrived from the United States or Israel.</p>\n<p>During his time in Yemen, Pham also assisted with the preparation and dissemination of AQAP\u2019s propaganda magazine, <em>Inspire</em>.\u00a0 Pham worked directly with now-deceased U.S. citizen Samir Khan, who was a prominent member of AQAP responsible for editing and publishing <em>Inspire</em>.\u00a0 Pham, who has college degrees in both graphic design and animation, received training in the various types of software used for <em>Inspire</em> and worked closely with Khan, contributing to the magazine in numerous ways.\u00a0 Pham used graphic design software to edit videos and photos that would be used as propaganda in <em>Inspire</em>; recorded television programs that Khan might find useful to the magazine; and offered his camera to be used for the taking of numerous photos used for <em>Inspire</em>.\u00a0 Pham also posed in photographs that accompanied <em>Inspire</em> articles and provided instructions to its followers.\u00a0 Among those were a series of photographs accompanying an article with instructions on disassembling and cleaning a Kalashnikov assault rifle.\u00a0 In another photograph, accompanying an article entitled, \u201cWhy Did I Choose Al Qaeda,\u201d which was written by al-Aulaqi, Pham and three other men were shown wielding automatic Kalashnikov assault rifles.\u00a0 In addition, AQAP trained Pham in the use of a Kalashnikov assault rifle and provided him such a rifle, which he used in furtherance of his activities on behalf of AQAP in Yemen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On July 27, 2011, Pham returned to the United Kingdom.\u00a0 Upon his arrival at London\u2019s Heathrow International Airport, U.K. authorities detained Pham, searched him and recovered various materials from him, including various electronic media that contained computer files forensically identical to those possessed by a cooperating witness who had previously reported sharing electronic documents with Pham while they were in Yemen with AQAP.\u00a0 In addition, Pham was found to be in possession of a live round of .762 caliber armor-piercing ammunition, which is consistent with ammunition that is used in a Kalashnikov assault rifle.</p>\n<p>Pham was arrested in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2012, and extradited to the United States in February 2015.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 40 year prison sentence, U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Southern District of New York also imposed a life term of supervised release and a $300 special assessment.\u00a0 On Jan. 8, 2016, Judge Nathan issued an order that Pham be removed from the United States to the United Kingdom upon completion of his sentence.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlin joined U.S. Attorney Bharara in praising the extraordinary investigative work of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office.\u00a0 They also expressed their gratitude to the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force for the critical role it played in the investigation and prosecution.\u00a0 Assistant Attorney General Carlin and U.S. Attorney Bharara also thanked the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs for their significant assistance, as well as the Metropolitan Police Service/SO 15 Counter Terrorism Command at New Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service for their cooperation in the investigation and prosecution.</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anna M. Skotko, Sean S. Buckley, Shane T. Stansbury and Ian McGinley of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from Trial Attorney Rebecca Magnone of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section.</p></div>",

Cote also ordered Budovsky to pay a $500,000 fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe significant sentence handed down today shows that money laundering through the use of virtual currencies is still money laundering, and that online crime is still crime,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.\u00a0 \u201cTogether with our American and international law enforcement partners, we will protect the public even when criminals use modern technology to break the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiberty Reserve founder Arthur Budovsky ran a digital currency empire built expressly to facilitate money laundering on a massive scale for criminals around the globe,\u201d said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Bharara.\u00a0 \u201cDespite all his efforts to evade prosecution, including taking his operations offshore and renouncing his citizenship, Budovsky has now been held to account for his brazen violations of U.S. criminal laws.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Liberty Reserve billed itself as the Internet\u2019s \u201clargest payment processor and money transfer system\u201d and allowed people all over the world to send and receive payments using virtual currency.\u00a0 At all relevant times, Budovsky directed and supervised Liberty Reserve\u2019s operations, finances, and business strategy and was aware that digital currencies were used by other online criminals, such as credit card traffickers and identity thieves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Liberty Reserve grew into a financial hub for cybercriminals around the world, trafficking the criminal proceeds of Ponzi schemes, credit card trafficking, stolen identity information and computer hacking.\u00a0 By May 2013, when the government shut it down, Liberty Reserve had more than 5.5 million user accounts worldwide and had processed more than 78 million financial transactions with a combined value of more than $8 billion.\u00a0 United States users accounted for the largest segment of Liberty Reserve\u2019s total transactional volume \u2013 between $1 billion and $1.8 billion \u2013 and the largest number of user accounts \u2013 over 600,000.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Four co-defendants, Vladimir Kats, Azzeddine El Amine, Mark Marmilev and Maxim Chukharev, have already pleaded guilty.\u00a0 Marmilev and Chukharev were sentenced to five years and three years in prison, respectively.\u00a0 Judge Cote is expected to sentence Kats and El Amine May 13. Charges remain pending against Liberty Reserve and two individual defendants who are fugitives.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations investigated this case as part of the Global Illicit Financial Team.\u00a0 The U.S. Secret Service\u2019s New York Electronic Crimes Task Force assisted with the investigation.\u00a0 The Judicial Investigation Organization in Costa Rica, Interpol, the National High Tech Crime Unit in the Netherlands, the Spanish National Police\u2019s Financial and Economic Crime Unit, the Cyber Crime Unit at the Swedish National Bureau of Investigation and the Swiss Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office also provided assistance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trial Attorney Kevin Mosley of the Criminal Division\u2019s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christian Everdell, Christine Magdo and Andrew Goldstein of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.\u00a0 The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section provided substantial assistance.</p></div>",

White \u00a0for the Northern District of California, some of the victims and their parents testified about the impact of Johnston\u2019s actions. \u00a0One of the victims, who was between 13 and 14 years old at the time of the offenses, told Johnston during the sentencing hearing, \u201cYou took away my childhood.\u00a0 You took me away from my family.\u00a0 You killed who I could have been.\u00a0 But I am free now, free to live without fears.\u201d\u00a0 Another minor victim told the judge that \u201cIn November of 2014, when Homeland Security contacted me\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. when I found out the nature of the situation, I was sick to my stomach.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTelling my mother broke her heart because she had no idea whatsoever of what was going on.\u201d \u00a0Two mothers of victims said that they had no idea what was going on with their daughters until Homeland Security agents showed up at their door.\u00a0 One mother of a teenage victim told the judge that her family and her daughter have been dealing with nightmares almost every night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In handing down the sentence, U.S. District Judge White described Johnston\u2019s conduct as \u201cunusually heinous,\u201d \u201ccruel, degrading and completely inhumane to other individuals and it is a sad day for our society when people engage in the kind of behavior that the defendant [did].\u201d\u00a0 U.S. District Judge White said that Johnston \u201cpreyed upon [the child victims\u2019] low self-esteem\u201d and used \u201cextreme cunning, guile, intelligence, strategies and a lot of thought and a lot of skill.\u201d\u00a0 U.S. District Judge White said that, in all of his years as a judge, the \u201cCourt has never seen\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. such serious, heinous behavior.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge White sentenced the defendant to a lifetime period of supervised release and ordered no contact with victims or minors without the permission of his probation officer.\u00a0 Johnston must register as a sexual offender as required by state law.\u00a0 Full restitution to the victims of defendant\u2019s crimes will be ordered, and the court will determine the final restitution amounts on June 28.\u00a0 The defendant has been detained since his arrest, so he will immediately begin serving his sentence.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Maureen Bessette and Christina McCall are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Vanessa Vargas Quant, Melissa Dorton and Patty Lau.\u00a0 The prosecution is the result of an investigation by: Homeland Security Investigation\u2019s Cyber Crimes Child Exploitation Group; Martinez Police Department; Salem Police Department in Oregon; the Contra Costa County District Attorney\u2019s Office; the Malaysia Royal Police; numerous law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom; the Irish Garda; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; and the Australian Federal Police.</p></div>",

Lynch, Director James B. Comey of the FBI, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn unsealing this indictment, the Department of Justice is sending a powerful message: that we will not allow any individual, group, or nation to sabotage American financial institutions or undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market,\u201d said Attorney General Lynch.\u00a0 \u201cThrough the work of our National Security Division, the FBI, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices around the country, we will continue to pursue national security cyber threats through the use of all available tools, including public criminal charges.\u00a0 And as today\u2019s unsealing makes clear, individuals who engage in computer hacking will be exposed for their criminal conduct and sought for apprehension and prosecution in an American court of law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe FBI will find those behind cyber intrusions and hold them accountable \u2014 wherever they are, and whoever they are,\u201d said Director Comey. \u00a0\u201cBy calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cThis indictment once again shows there is no such veil \u2013 we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe charges announced today respond directly to a cyber-assault on New York, its institutions and its infrastructure,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Bharara.\u00a0 \u201cThe alleged onslaught of cyber-attacks on 46 of our largest financial institutions, many headquartered in New York City, resulted in hundreds of thousands of customers being unable to access their accounts and tens of millions of dollars being spent by the companies trying to stay online through these attacks.\u00a0 The infiltration of the Bowman Avenue dam represents a frightening new frontier in cybercrime.\u00a0 These were no ordinary crimes, but calculated attacks by groups with ties to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard and designed specifically to harm America and its people.\u00a0 We now live in a world where devastating attacks on our financial system, our infrastructure and our way of life can be launched from anywhere in the world, with a click of a mouse.\u00a0 Confronting these types of cyber-attacks cannot be the job of just law enforcement.\u00a0 The charges announced today should serve as a wake-up call for everyone responsible for the security of our financial markets and for guarding our infrastructure.\u00a0 Our future security depends on heeding this call.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the indictment unsealed today in federal court in New York City:</p>\n<p><em><u>DDoS Attacks</u></em></p>\n<p>The DDoS campaign began in approximately December 2011, and the attacks occurred only sporadically until September 2012, at which point they escalated in frequency to a near-weekly basis, between Tuesday and Thursdays during normal business hours in the United States.\u00a0 On certain days during the campaign, victim computer servers were hit with as much as 140 gigabits of data per second and hundreds of thousands of customers were cut off from online access to their bank accounts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fathi, Firoozi and Shokohi were responsible for ITSEC\u2019s portion of the DDoS campaign against the U.S. financial sector and are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit and aid and abet computer hacking.\u00a0 Fathi was the leader of ITSEC and was responsible for supervising and coordinating ITSEC\u2019s portion of the DDoS campaign, along with managing computer intrusion and cyberattack projects being conducted for the government of Iran.\u00a0 Firoozi was the network manager at ITSEC and, in that role, procured and managed computer servers that were used to coordinate and direct ITSEC\u2019s portion of the DDoS campaign.\u00a0 Shokohi is a computer hacker who helped build the botnet used by ITSEC to carry out its portion of the DDoS campaign and created malware used to direct the botnet to engage in those attacks.\u00a0 During the time that he worked in support of the DDoS campaign, Shokohi received credit for his computer intrusion work from the Iranian government towards his completion of his mandatory military service requirement in Iran.</p>\n<p>Ahmadzadegan, Ghaffarinia, Keissar and Saedi were responsible for managing the botnet used in MERSAD\u2019s portion of the campaign, and are also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit and aid and abet computer hacking.\u00a0 Ahmadzadegan was a co-founder of MERSAD and was responsible for managing the botnet used in MERSAD\u2019s portion of the DDoS campaign.\u00a0 He was also associated with Iranian hacking groups Sun Army and the Ashiyane Digital Security Team (ADST), and claimed responsibility for hacking servers belonging to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in February 2012.\u00a0 Ahmadzadegan has also provided training to Iranian intelligence personnel.\u00a0 Ghaffarinia was a co-founder of MERSAD and created malicious computer code used to compromise computer servers and build MERSAD\u2019s botnet.\u00a0 Ghaffarinia was also associated with Sun Army and ADST, and has also claimed responsibility for hacking NASA servers in February 2012, as well as thousands of other servers in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.\u00a0 Keissar procured computer servers used by MERSAD to access and manipulate MERSAD\u2019s botnet, and also performed preliminary testing of the same botnet prior to its use in MERSAD\u2019s portion of the DDoS campaign.\u00a0 Saedi was an employee of MERSAD and a former Sun Army computer hacker who expressly touted himself as an expert in DDoS attacks.\u00a0 Saedi wrote computer scripts used to locate vulnerable servers to build the MERSAD botnet used in its portion of the DDoS campaign.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of carrying out the attacks, each group built and maintained their own botnets, which consisted of thousands of compromised computer systems owned by unwitting third parties that had been infected with the defendants\u2019 malware, and subject to their remote command and control.\u00a0 The defendants and/or their unindicted co-conspirators then sent orders to their botnets to direct significant amounts of malicious traffic at computer servers used to operate the websites for victim financial institutions, which overwhelmed victim servers and disabled them from customers seeking to legitimately access the websites or their online bank accounts.\u00a0 Although the DDoS campaign caused damage to the financial sector victims and interfered with their customers\u2019 ability to do online banking, the attacks did not affect or result in the theft of customer account data.</p>\n<p><em><u>DDoS Botnet Remediation</u></em></p>\n<p>Since the attacks, the Department of Justice and the FBI have worked together with the private sector to effectively neutralize and remediate the defendants\u2019 botnets.\u00a0 Specifically, through approximately 20 FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) messages, the FBI regularly provided updated information collected from the investigation regarding the identity of systems that been infected with the defendants\u2019 malware and operating as bots within the malicious botnets.\u00a0 In addition, the FBI conducted extensive direct outreach to Internet service providers responsible for hosting systems that have been infected with the defendants\u2019 malware to provide them information and assistance in removing the malware to protect their customers and other potential victims of the defendants\u2019 unlawful cyber activities.\u00a0 Through these outreach efforts and the cooperation of the private sector, over 95 percent of the known part of the defendants\u2019 botnets have been successfully remediated.</p>\n<p><em><u>Bowman Dam Intrusion</u></em></p>\n<p>Between Aug. 28, 2013, and Sept. 18, 2013, Firoozi repeatedly obtained unauthorized access to the SCADA systems of the Bowman Dam, and is charged with one substantive count of obtaining and aiding and abetting computer hacking.\u00a0 This unauthorized access allowed him to repeatedly obtain information regarding the status and operation of the dam, including information about the water levels, temperature and status of the sluice gate, which is responsible for controlling water levels and flow rates.\u00a0 Although that access would normally have permitted Firoozi to remotely operate and manipulate the Bowman Dam\u2019s sluice gate, Firoozi did not have that capability because the sluice gate had been manually disconnected for maintenance at the time of the intrusion.</p>\n<p>Remediation for the Bowman Dam intrusion cost over $30,000.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>All seven defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit and aid and abet computer hacking.\u00a0 Firoozi faces an additional five years in prison for obtaining and aiding and abetting unauthorized access to a protected computer at the Bowman Dam.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an accusation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The case was investigated by the FBI, including the Chicago; Cincinnati; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Phoenix; and San Francisco Field Offices.\u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy T. Howard of the Southern District of New York, with the substantial assistance of Deputy Chief Sean M. Newell of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png\" title=\"application/pdf\"/> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/824691/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\">Fathi et al Indictment.pdf</a></p></div>",

Snyder of the Central District of California.</p>\n<p>The guilty plea was announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin, U.S. Attorney Eileen M. Decker of the Central District of California, Assistant Director Jim Trainor of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division and Assistant Director in Charge David Bowdich of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Division.</p>\n<p>A criminal complaint filed in 2014 and subsequent indictments filed in Los Angeles charged Su, a China-based businessman in the aviation and aerospace fields, for his role in the criminal conspiracy to steal military technical data, including data relating to the C-17 strategic transport aircraft and certain fighter jets produced for the U.S. military.\u00a0 Su was initially arrested in Canada in July 2014 on a warrant issued in relation to this case.\u00a0 Su ultimately waived extradition and consented to be conveyed to the United States in February 2016.</p>\n<p>\u201cSu Bin admitted to playing an important role in a conspiracy, originating in China, to illegally access sensitive military data, including data relating to military aircraft that are indispensable in keeping our military personnel safe,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cThis plea sends a strong message that stealing from the United States and our companies has a significant cost; we can and will find these criminals and bring them to justice.\u00a0 The National Security Division remains sharply focused on disrupting cyber threats to the national security, and we will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who seek to undermine our security.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProtecting our national security is the highest priority of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and cybercrime represents one of the most serious threats to our national security,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Decker.\u00a0 \u201cThe innovative and tireless work of the prosecutors and investigators in this case is a testament to our collective commitment to protecting our nation\u2019s security from all threats. Today\u2019s guilty plea and conviction demonstrate that these criminals can be held accountable no matter where they are located in the world and that we are deeply committed to protecting our sensitive data in order to keep our nation safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCyber security is a top priority not only for the FBI but the entire U.S. government,\u201d said Assistant Director Trainor. \u00a0\u201cOur greatest strength is when we harness our capabilities to work together, and today\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates this. \u00a0Our adversaries\u2019 capabilities are constantly evolving, and we will remain vigilant in combating the cyber threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis investigation demonstrates the FBI\u2019s resolve in holding foreign cyber actors accountable regardless of where they reside,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge Bowdich.\u00a0 \u201cCybercrime investigators in Los Angeles are among the finest and their efforts toward preserving America's national security in this case should be commended.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the plea agreement filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court of the Central District of California, Su admitted to conspiring with two persons in China from October 2008 to March 2014 to gain unauthorized access to protected computer networks in the United States, including computers belonging to the Boeing Company in Orange County, California, to obtain sensitive military information and to export that information illegally from the United States to China.</p>\n<p>As part of the conspiracy, Su would e-mail the co-conspirators with guidance regarding what persons, companies and technologies to target during their computer intrusions.\u00a0 One of Su\u2019s co-conspirators would then gain access to information residing on computers of U.S. companies and email Su directory file listings and folders showing the data that the co-conspirator had been able to access.\u00a0 Su then directed his co-conspirator as to which files and folders his co-conspirator should steal. \u00a0Once the co-conspirator stole the data, including by using techniques to avoid detection when hacking the victim computers, Su translated the contents of certain stolen data from English into Chinese. \u00a0In addition, Su and his co-conspirators each wrote, revised and emailed reports about the information and technology they had acquired by their hacking activities, including its value, to the final beneficiaries of their hacking activities.</p>\n<p>Su\u2019s plea agreement makes clear that the information he and his co-conspirators intentionally stole included data listed on the U.S. Munitions List contained in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. \u00a0Su also admitted that he engaged in the crime for the purpose of financial gain and specifically sought to profit from selling the data the he and his co-conspirators illegally acquired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Su faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest.\u00a0 Judge Snyder is scheduled to sentence Su on July 13, 2016.</p>\n<p>The case is being investigated by the FBI Los Angeles Field Office\u2019s Cyber Division with assistance from the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations.</p>\n<p>This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony J. Lewis of the Central District of California and Trial Attorney Casey Arrowood and Senior Trial Attorney Robert E.

Carlin and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEvgeny Buryakov pleaded guilty to covertly working as a Russian agent in the United States without notifying the Attorney General,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cForeign nations who attempt to illegally gather economic and other intelligence information through espionage pose a direct threat to U.S. national security.\u00a0 The National Security Division will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and hold accountable those who illegally operate as covert agents within the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn unregistered intelligence agent, under cover of being a legitimate banker, gathers intelligence on the streets of New York City, trading coded messages with Russian spies who send the clandestinely collected information back to Moscow,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Bharara.\u00a0 \u201cThis sounds like a plotline for a Cold War-era movie, but in reality, Evgeny Buryakov pled guilty today to a federal crime for his role in just such a scheme.\u00a0 More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, Russian spies still seek to operate in our midst under the cover of secrecy.\u00a0 But in New York, thanks to the work of the FBI and the prosecutors in my office, attempts to conduct unlawful espionage will not be overlooked.\u00a0 They will be investigated and prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to indictment, other court filings and statements made during court proceedings:</p>\n<p>Beginning in at least 2012, Buryakov worked in the United States as an agent of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, known as the SVR.\u00a0 Buryakov operated under non-official cover, meaning he entered and remained in the United States as a private citizen, posing as an employee in the New York office of a Russian bank, Vnesheconombank (VEB).\u00a0 SVR agents operating under such non-official cover (NOCs) are typically subject to less scrutiny by the host government and, in many cases, are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government.\u00a0 As a result, an NOC is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the SVR.</p>\n<p>Federal law prohibits individuals from acting as agents of foreign governments within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.\u00a0 Department of Justice records indicate that Buryakov never notified the Attorney General that he was, in fact, an agent of the Russia Federation.</p>\n<p>Buryakov worked in New York with at least two other SVR agents, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy.\u00a0 From on or about Nov. 22, 2010, to on or about Nov. 21, 2014, Sporyshev officially served as a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York.\u00a0 From on or about Dec. 13, 2012, to on or about Sept. 12, 2013, Podobnyy officially served as an attach\u00e9 to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.\u00a0 The investigation, however, showed that Sporyshev and Podobnyy also worked as officers of the SVR.\u00a0 Sporyshev and Podobnyy were charged along with Buryakov in January 2015, however, Sporyshev and Podobnyy no longer lived in the United States at that time and were not arrested.</p>\n<p>The directives from the SVR to Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy, as well as to other covert SVR agents acting within the United States, included requests to gather intelligence on, among other subjects, potential U.S. sanctions against Russian banks and the United States\u2019 efforts to develop alternative energy resources.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the course of their work as covert SVR agents in the United States, Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy regularly met and communicated using clandestine methods and coded messages in order to exchange intelligence-related information while shielding their associations with one another as SVR agents. \u00a0Sporyshev was responsible for relaying intelligence assignments from the SVR to Buryakov.</p>\n<p>On or about March 28, 2014, Sporyshev was recorded telling Buryakov that he needed help researching the \u201ceffects of economic sanctions on our country,\u201d among other things.\u00a0 A few days later, on April 2, 2014, Sporyshev called Buryakov and stated, in an intercepted conversation, that he had not seen Buryakov in a while, and asked to meet Buryakov outside VEB\u2019s office in New York in 20 minutes.\u00a0 A court-authorized search of Buryakov\u2019s computer at VEB revealed that, at around the time of this telephone call, Buryakov conducted the following internet searches: \u201csanctions Russia consiquences\u201d [sic] and \u201csanctions Russia impact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two days later, on April 4, 2014, Buryakov called Sporyshev and in an intercepted conversation, stated that he \u201cwrote you an order list,\u201d and suggested that they meet.\u00a0 Approximately 20 minutes later, Sporyshev met Buryakov in the driveway of Buryakov\u2019s home.\u00a0 Their encounter, which was captured by a video surveillance camera located near Buryakov\u2019s residence, lasted approximately two minutes.\u00a0 On the video footage, the defendants appeared to exchange a small object.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2014, Buryakov met multiple times with a confidential source working for the FBI and an FBI undercover employee, both of whom purported to be working on a casino development project in Russia. \u00a0During these meetings, Buryakov accepted documents that were purportedly obtained from a U.S. government agency and which supposedly contained information potentially useful to Russia, including information about U.S. sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>Buryakov will be sentenced on May 25, 2016,\u00a0where he faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlin joined U.S. Attorney Bharara in praising the investigative work of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.</p>\n<p>The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Emil J. Bove III, Brendan F. Quigley and Stephen J. Ritchin of the Southern District of New York, with assistance provided by Senior Trial Attorney Heather Schmidt of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. \u00a0</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.justice.gov/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png\" title=\"application/pdf\"/> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/media/1082676/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\">Buryakov Plea Agreement</a></p></div>",

Carlin, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez of the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office and Commissioner William J. Bratton of the New York City Police Department. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPugh, an American citizen and former member of the U.S. Air Force where he served as an aircraft mechanic, attempted to travel to Syria to provide material support to ISIL,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cThis is the first conviction after a trial by jury in the United States involving an individual who attempted to travel to Syria to join ISIL, and further demonstrates our commitment to bring to justice all those who seek to provide material support to terrorists.\u00a0 I would like to thank all the members of law enforcement whose tireless efforts made this result possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict provides yet another example of a successful outcome in our national security effort, and demonstrates the crucial role that law enforcement action plays in that effort,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Capers.\u00a0 \u201cThe evidence presented at trial and the jury\u2019s verdict instill confidence that our law enforcement agencies and their many important partners at home and abroad work effectively to disrupt and defeat the deadly siren\u2019s call of terrorist groups around the globe.\u00a0 Pugh has now been held accountable for his crimes by a jury and will not reach the terrorist group he sought to support.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs presented in trial, Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh was willing to become a martyr, using his U.S. military training as a weapon for ISIL,\u201d said Assistant Director in Charge Rodriguez.\u00a0 \u201cInstead, found guilty of his crimes, he is facing a lengthy incarceration.\u00a0 We are pleased the jury found his actions confirmed his expressed desire to cause violence and destruction on behalf of this terrorist organization.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Forces continue to work globally with our partners to successfully stop such actions before they happen, keep communities safe and bring criminals to justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe applaud today\u2019s verdict, finding the first ISIL defendant guilty after attempting to travel to Syria and wage jihad,\" <span>said Commissioner Bratton.</span>\u00a0 \"Those who adhere to ISIL\u2019s deadly terrorist agenda should be on notice: reject this ideology or face swift justice in American courts. It is fitting that the first ISIL conviction case is here in the Eastern District of New York, which has prosecuted more terrorism cases than any other district in the country. It is to them \u2014 and the many others on the Joint Terrorism Task Force \u2014 that New Yorkers owe their gratitude for the relentless efforts to keep our city safe.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>At trial, the government presented evidence that prior to traveling overseas to try to join ISIL, Pugh served in the Air Force as an avionics instrument system specialist and received training in the installation and maintenance of aircraft engines, navigation and weapons systems.\u00a0 After leaving the Air Force, the defendant worked for a number of companies in the United States and Middle East as an airplane mechanic.\u00a0 Pugh lived abroad for over a year before his arrest in this case. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Jan. 10, 2015, the defendant traveled from Egypt to Turkey in an effort to cross the border into Syria to join ISIL to engage in violent \u201cjihad.\u201d\u00a0 However, Turkish authorities denied the defendant entry and returned him to Egypt.\u00a0 At the time of his detention, Pugh was carrying a laptop computer and four USB thumb drives that he had stripped of their plastic casings in an effort to destroy their contents and thereby make them unavailable to investigators.\u00a0 The defendant also was carrying solar power chargers, compasses and a black ski mask.\u00a0 Foreign government officials deported the defendant to the United States, where the FBI closely monitored him, relying in part on a covert undercover employee who encountered the defendant at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.\u00a0 The defendant was arrested on Jan. 16, 2015, in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and thereafter indicted in the Eastern District of New York.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government presented evidence obtained from the defendant\u2019s laptop computer and social media posts.\u00a0 The defendant\u2019s laptop contained Internet searches for \u201cborders controlled by Islamic state.\u201d\u00a0 The government also introduced evidence of the defendant\u2019s Internet searches for \u201cFlames of War\u201d (an ISIL propaganda video) as well as terrorist videos he had downloaded, including one horrific video showing ISIL members executing prisoners.\u00a0 In addition, statements to coworkers and social media posts established Pugh\u2019s empathy and support for ISIL\u2019s cause and terrorist methods.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government also introduced a letter drafted by Pugh on Jan. 5, 2015, shortly before he left Egypt for Turkey on his way to Syria.\u00a0 In that letter, the defendant proclaimed, \u201cI am a Mujahid.\u00a0 I am a sword against the oppressor and a shield for the oppressed.\u00a0 I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic State.\u00a0 There is only 2 possible outcomes for me.\u00a0 Victory or Martyr.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Based on his trial convictions, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of up to 35 years in prison.\u00a0 Sentencing has not yet been scheduled, but is expected to occur later this year.</p>\n<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlin joined U.S. Attorney Capers in extending his grateful appreciation to the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), as well as to the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of New Jersey, the Asbury Park Police Department and the Neptune Police Department.</p>\n<p>The government\u2019s case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Samuel P.

    "description_html_excel_safe": "<div class=\"field-formatter--text-default field-text-format--wysiwyg text-formatted field_body\"><p>Richard Wyatt, 52, of Evergreen, Colorado, surrendered to authorities today on charges of conspiracy, dealing in firearms without a license and tax related charges, U.S. Attorney John Walsh for the District of Colorado, Special Agent in Charge Stephen Boyd for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \u2013 Criminal Investigations (CI) Denver Division and Special Agent in Charge Ken Croke for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Denver Field Division announced.\u00a0 Wyatt will make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen L. Mix today, where he will be advised of his rights and the charges pending against him.\u00a0 Wyatt was the subject of a 13-count federal grand jury indictment in Denver, Colorado, returned on Feb. 9, 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the indictment, Wyatt allegedly illegally sold firearms and he also failed to report over $1.1 million in income.\u00a0 Wyatt operated Gunsmoke, a store in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, that displayed firearm and firearm accessories for sale.\u00a0 Wyatt was the principal decision maker for the store and controlled the store\u2019s bank account.\u00a0 In addition to holding itself out as a business that bought and sold firearms, Gunsmoke provided gunsmithing services.\u00a0 Wyatt aggressively publicized his business by posting videos on YouTube and by appearing in a reality television series that appeared on the Discovery Channel.\u00a0 The reality TV show aired from 2011 through 2012, showing a total of 26 episodes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Feb. 17, 2012, Wyatt conspired with others known to the grand jury but not named, to deal in firearms without a license.\u00a0 In April 2012, the defendant surrendered his Federal Firearms License (FFL) due to his violations of federal laws and regulations.\u00a0 After Gunsmoke surrendered its FFL, Gunsmoke changed the address of a store known as Triggers Firearms LLC (Triggers), a federal firearms license, to the Gunsmoke address, although they did not play any role in managing the store or receive any profits.\u00a0 Thereafter, Wyatt continued to operate Gunsmoke as a retail firearms store that also offered gunsmithing services, but never held an ownership interest in Triggers or assumed management of Triggers.\u00a0 Wyatt and other conspirators submitted false paperwork to the ATF to hide that Triggers was acting as a straw licensee for Gunsmoke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After losing his FFL, the defendant did not apply for or obtain a license to sell firearms from the Gunsmoke premises.\u00a0 Wyatt held a meeting the day before losing his license with his employees to describe how he wanted the business to continue to run.\u00a0 During April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2015, no other person was licensed to engage in the business of dealing in firearms at Gunsmoke, \u00a0Wyatt directed Gunsmoke employees to enter firearm sales in Gunsmoke\u2019s computer point of sales software system as \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d sales rather than firearm sales.\u00a0 Customers who shopped at Gunsmoke were able to look at numerous firearms that were displayed throughout the store.\u00a0 Customers were able to speak with Gunsmoke employees, including Wyatt, about the features of particular firearms.\u00a0 Finally, customers selected and purchased firearms from Gunsmoke and were able to have gunsmithing services performed on firearms at the Gunsmoke premises.\u00a0 After receiving payment for any firearms, Gunsmoke employees directed the customers to another firearm store which had a valid federal firearms license, where the customer filled out the background check paperwork and the customers took possession of the firearm(s) they had purchased at Gunsmoke.\u00a0 Customers who wanted gunsmithing services left their firearms with Gunsmoke.\u00a0 After the gunsmiths at Gunsmoke completed their work, they returned the firearms to the customers.\u00a0 The customers paid Gunsmoke directly for this service. \u00a0Wyatt, without the FFL license, continued to order new guns for sale to keep the business going.</p>\n<p>In addition to the alleged firearms violations, Wyatt failed to pay personal income tax in years 2009, when he made approximately $290,000, in 2010, when he made approximately $123,000, and in 2012, when he made approximately $689,000.\u00a0 Further, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, Wyatt failed to pay corporate taxes.\u00a0 In 2012, Wyatt willfully filed a tax return he knew to be false, stating that he lost money, when in fact he made at least $184,000 that he failed to disclose.\u00a0 The defendant also faces an asset forfeiture count, including but not limited to the forfeiture of firearms and ammunition involved in the commission of the alleged crimes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wyatt faces two counts of conspiracy, with each count carrying a penalty of not more than five years in federal prison and up to a $250,000 fine.\u00a0 He faces three counts of dealing in firearms without a license, with each count carrying a penalty of not more than five years in federal prison and up to a $250,000 fine.\u00a0 The defendant faces one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a penalty of not more than three years in federal prison and up to a $100,000 fine.\u00a0 Lastly, Wyatt faces seven counts of failure to file a tax return, each count of which carries a penalty of not more than one year in federal prison and up to a $25,000 fine.</p>\n<p>This case was investigated by the IRS-CI and the ATF.\u00a0 The defendant is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Suneeta Hazra and Anna Edgar, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Tonya Andrews assisting on the asset forfeiture.</p>\n<p>The charges contained in this indictment are allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p></div>",

In fact, as Abramoff and Andrade knew, the NAC Foundation did not have the funds to purchase the advertising time, did not intend to air the television commercial, and the advertisement was not reviewed or rejected by the television network or the NFL.\u00a0 Abramoff and Andrade used paid op-ed articles, social media, and AML Bitcoin press releases to make statements that the commercial had been rejected in order to promote AML Bitcoin to prospective purchasers.\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andrade, Abramoff, and Andrade\u2019s NAC Foundation allegedly made false statements to the public and potential purchasers of AML Bitcoin that misrepresented the state of the development of the technology and the viability and timeline for the release of AML Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andrade, with assistance of Abramoff, allegedly made statements that falsely stated and implied NAC Foundation had reached or was about to finalize agreements with various government agencies for the use of AML Bitcoin or AML Bitcoin technology.\u00a0 The statements were intended to convince prospective purchasers that the cryptocurrency was progressing toward widespread adoption.\u00a0 In addition, Abramoff allegedly retained writers to disseminate these statements as op-eds published on various news and financial websites.\u00a0 Included among the false claims were claims that the NAC Foundation was near a partnership with the Panama Canal Authority to permit AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement or negotiations existed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andrade allegedly diverted more than $1 million obtained through the sale of AML Bitcoin and spent it on personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas.\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Andrade allegedly laundered funds from the venture by steering investor assets through various bank accounts before moving them into an account for Andrade\u2019s personal expenses and the purchase of the two properties.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information filed against Abramoff also alleges that he knowingly and corruptly failed to register as a lobbyist, as required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act, after being retained for lobbying efforts that would involve one or more lobbying communications with a federal official.\u00a0 This is the first ever known prosecution of a lobbyist for a criminal violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\u00a0 The information alleges that during part of 2017, Abramoff was retained by a client in the marijuana industry, and that the engagement in part involved efforts to advocate for changes in federal law and policy.\u00a0 The information also alleges that in June 2017, an FBI undercover agent, posing as a business person seeking to fund lobbying efforts, agreed to retain Abramoff for lobbying activities including lobbying contacts.\u00a0 After being retained, and after having a later lobbying contact with a federal elected official, Abramoff failed to register as a lobbyist with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives within 45 days of the retention or the contact, as required by the Act.</p>\n<p>In sum, Andrade is charged in the indictment with one count of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01343, and one count of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1).\u00a0 Abramoff is charged in the information with one count of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0371, and one count of violating the provisions of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, in violation of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01606(b).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Andrade was arrested on June 23, 2020, in Missouri City, Texas, and appeared before a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Houston, Texas.\u00a0 He was released on bond pending his initial San Francisco federal court appearance, which is set before the duty U.S. Magistrate Judge on July 1, 2020.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Abramoff has filed a stipulated notice of an intent to change plea pursuant to a plea agreement.\u00a0 The hearing for intended change of plea has not yet been scheduled.</p>\n<p>An information and an indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Andrade faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate, for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01343, and a maximum sentence of 20 years and a fine of $500,000 for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1).\u00a0 Abramoff faces a maximum sentence of 5 years, and a fine of $250,000 for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0371, and a maximum sentence of 5 years and a fine of $250,000, for violation of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01606(b).\u00a0 However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In separate civil actions filed on June 25, 2020, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Andrade and Abramoff, alleging securities fraud and acting as unregistered brokers of securities, among other charges.</p>\n<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lloyd Farnham and Andrew Dawson are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Kimberly Richardson.\u00a0 The prosecution is being conducted by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office new Corporate Fraud Strike Force.\u00a0 The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations with the assistance of the San Francisco Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p></div>",

The defendants are Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33, a Russian national and resident; Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43, a Russian national and resident; Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan, aka \u201cMagg,\u201d 29, a Russian national and resident; and Karim Baratov, aka \u201cKay,\u201d \u201cKarim Taloverov\u201d and \u201cKarim Akehmet Tokbergenov,\u201d 22, a Canadian and Kazakh national and a resident of Canada.</p>\n<p>The defendants used unauthorized access to Yahoo\u2019s systems to steal information from about at least 500 million Yahoo accounts and then used some of that stolen information to obtain unauthorized access to the contents of accounts at Yahoo, Google and other webmail providers, including accounts of Russian journalists, U.S. and Russian government officials and private-sector employees of financial, transportation and other companies. One of the defendants also exploited his access to Yahoo\u2019s network for his personal financial gain, by searching Yahoo user communications for credit card and gift card account numbers, redirecting a subset of Yahoo search engine web traffic so he could make commissions and enabling the theft of the contacts of at least 30 million Yahoo accounts to facilitate a spam campaign.</p>\n<p>The charges were announced by U.S. Attorney Brian J. Stretch, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director James Comey of the FBI, Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord of the National Security Division, and Executive Assistant Director Paul Abbate of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s computer infrastructure provides the means by which people around the world communicate with each other in their business and personal lives. The privacy and security of those communications must be governed by the rule of law, not by the whim of criminal hackers and those who employ them. People rightly expect that their communications through Silicon Valley internet providers will remain private, unless lawful authority provides otherwise. We will not tolerate unauthorized and illegal intrusions into the Silicon Valley computer infrastructure upon which both private citizens and the global economy rely,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Stretch. \u201cWorking closely with Yahoo and Google, Department of Justice lawyers and the FBI were able to identify and expose the hackers responsible for the conduct described today, without unduly intruding into the privacy of the accounts that were stolen. We commend Yahoo and Google for providing exemplary cooperation while zealously protecting their users\u2019 privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCyber crime poses a significant threat to our nation\u2019s security and prosperity, and this is one of the largest data breaches in history,\u201d said Attorney General Sessions. \u201cBut thanks to the tireless efforts of U.S. prosecutors and investigators, as well as our Canadian partners, today we have identified four individuals, including two Russian FSB officers, responsible for unauthorized access to millions of users\u2019 accounts. The United States will vigorously investigate and prosecute the people behind such attacks to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday we continue to pierce the veil of anonymity surrounding cyber crimes,\u201d said Director Comey. \u201cWe are shrinking the world to ensure that cyber criminals think twice before targeting U.S. persons and interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI\u2019s point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \u201cOnce again, the Department and the FBI have demonstrated that hackers around the world can and will be exposed and held accountable. State actors may be using common criminals to access the data they want, but the indictment shows that our companies do not have to stand alone against this threat. We commend Yahoo and Google for their sustained and invaluable cooperation in the investigation aimed at obtaining justice for, and protecting the privacy of their users.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a highly complicated investigation of a very complex threat. It underscores the value of early, proactive engagement and cooperation between the private sector and the government,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Abbate. \u201cThe FBI will continue to work relentlessly with our private sector and international partners to identify those who conduct cyber-attacks against our citizens and our nation, expose them and hold them accountable under the law, no matter where they attempt to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Summary of Allegations</em></p>\n<p>According to the allegations of the Indictment:</p>\n<p>The FSB officer defendants, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, protected, directed, facilitated and paid criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the U.S. and elsewhere. In the present case, they worked with co-defendants Alexsey Belan and Karim Baratov to obtain access to the email accounts of thousands of individuals.</p>\n<p>Belan had been publicly indicted in September 2012 and June 2013 and was named one of FBI\u2019s Cyber Most Wanted criminals in November 2013. An Interpol Red Notice seeking his immediate detention has been lodged (including with Russia) since July 26, 2013. Belan was arrested in a European country on a request from the U.S. in June 2013, but he was able to escape to Russia before he could be extradited.</p>\n<p>Instead of acting on the U.S. government\u2019s Red Notice and detaining Belan after his return, Dokuchaev and Sushchin subsequently used him to gain unauthorized access to Yahoo\u2019s network. In or around November and December 2014, Belan stole a copy of at least a portion of Yahoo\u2019s User Database (UDB), a Yahoo trade secret that contained, among other data, subscriber information including users\u2019 names, recovery email accounts, phone numbers and certain information required to manually create, or \u201cmint,\u201d account authentication web browser \u201ccookies\u201d for more than 500 million Yahoo accounts.</p>\n<p>Belan also obtained unauthorized access on behalf of the FSB conspirators to Yahoo\u2019s Account Management Tool (AMT), which was a proprietary means by which Yahoo made and logged changes to user accounts. Belan, Dokuchaev and Sushchin then used the stolen UDB copy and AMT access to locate Yahoo email accounts of interest and to mint cookies for those accounts, enabling the co-conspirators to access at least 6,500 such accounts without authorization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some victim accounts were of predictable interest to the FSB, a foreign intelligence and law enforcement service, such as personal accounts belonging to Russian journalists; Russian and U.S. government officials; employees of a prominent Russian cybersecurity company; and numerous employees of other providers whose networks the conspirators sought to exploit. However, other personal accounts belonged to employees of commercial entities, such as a Russian investment banking firm, a French transportation company, U.S. financial services and private equity firms, a Swiss bitcoin wallet and banking firm and a U.S. airline.</p>\n<p>During the conspiracy, the FSB officers facilitated Belan\u2019s other criminal activities, by providing him with sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by U.S. and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia, including information regarding FSB investigations of computer hacking and FSB techniques for identifying criminal hackers. Additionally, while working with his FSB conspirators to compromise Yahoo\u2019s network and its users, Belan used his access to steal financial information such as gift card and credit card numbers from webmail accounts; to gain access to more than 30 million accounts whose contacts were then stolen to facilitate a spam campaign; and to earn commissions from fraudulently redirecting a subset of Yahoo\u2019s search engine traffic.</p>\n<p>When Dokuchaev and Sushchin learned that a target of interest had accounts at webmail providers other than Yahoo, including through information obtained as part of the Yahoo intrusion, they tasked their co-conspirator, Baratov, a resident of Canada, with obtaining unauthorized access to more than 80 accounts in exchange for commissions. On March 7, the Department of Justice submitted a provisional arrest warrant to Canadian law enforcement authorities, requesting Baratov\u2019s arrest. On March 14, Baratov was arrested in Canada and the matter is now pending with the Canadian authorities.</p>\n<p>An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The FBI, led by the San Francisco Field Office, conducted the investigation that resulted in the charges announced today. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, with support from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Defendants</strong>: At all times relevant to the charges, the Indictment alleges as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev</strong>, 33, was an officer in the FSB Center for Information Security, aka \u201cCenter 18.\u201d Dokuchaev was a Russian national and resident.</li>\n<li><strong>Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin</strong>, 43, was an FSB officer, a superior to Dokuchaev within the FSB, and a Russian national and resident. Sushchin was embedded as a purported employee and Head of Information Security at a Russian investment bank.</li>\n<li><strong>Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan</strong>, aka \u201cMagg,\u201d 29, was born in Latvia and is a Russian national and resident. U.S. Federal grand juries have indicted Belan twice before, in 2012 and 2013, for computer fraud and abuse, access device fraud and aggravated identity theft involving three U.S.-based e-commerce companies and the FBI placed Belan on its \u201cCyber Most Wanted\u201d list.\u00a0 Belan is currently the subject of a pending \u201cRed Notice\u201d requesting that Interpol member nations (including Russia) arrest him pending extradition. Belan was also one of two criminal hackers named by President Barack Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, pursuant to Executive Order 13694, as a Specially Designated National subject to sanctions.</li>\n<li><strong>Karim Baratov</strong>, aka \u201cKay,\u201d \u201cKarim Taloverov\u201d and \u201cKarim Akehmet Tokbergenov,\u201d 22. He is a Canadian and Kazakh national and a resident of Canada.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Victims</strong>: Yahoo; more than 500 million Yahoo accounts for which account information about was stolen by the defendants; more than 30 million Yahoo accounts for which account contents were accessed without authorization to facilitate a spam campaign; and at least 18 additional users at other webmail providers whose accounts were accessed without authorization.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Period</strong>: As alleged in the Indictment, the conspiracy began at least as early as 2014 and, even though the conspirators lost their access to Yahoo\u2019s networks in September 2016, they continued to utilize information stolen from the intrusion up to and including at least December 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Crimes</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Count(s)</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Defendant(s)</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Charge</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Statute 18 U.S.C.</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Conduct</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>Maximum Penalty</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><b><span>1</span></b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><span>All</span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><span>Conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse</span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><span>\u00a7 1030(b)</span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><span>Defendants conspired to hack into the computers of Yahoo and accounts maintained by Yahoo, Google and other providers to steal information from them. </span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>First, Belan gained access to Yahoo\u2019s servers and stole information that allowed him, Dokuchaev, and Sushchin to gain unauthorized access to individual Yahoo user accounts. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Then, Dokuchaev and Sushchin tasked Baratov with gaining access to individual user accounts at Google and other Providers (but not Yahoo) and paid Baratov for providing them with the account passwords.
