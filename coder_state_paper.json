Across early “information warfare” and computer network attack (CNA) literatures, authors confronted a persistent asymmetry: operations could be conducted remotely and transnationally, yet responsibility could remain uncertain at decision time. This paper provides a historical analysis of attribution discourse in that decade using a structured corpus of coded excerpts from legal, policy, and technical writings. We find three recurring patterns. First, a dominant “attribution-as-gateway” framing positioned self-defence and countermeasures as normatively available only when responsibility could be linked to a state or its agents. Second, the same corpus catalogued structural constraints—multi-jurisdiction routing, compromised intermediaries, and deception—that made rapid, high-confidence attribution difficult, thereby destabilising necessity and proportionality reasoning. Third, proposed remedies focused less on perfect identification than on procedural and institutional architectures: investigative cooperation, mutual legal assistance, extradition, and verification analogies, alongside proposals to narrow protected interests (critical infrastructure) or to soften legal consequences for good-faith responses under uncertainty.

Methodology / System Design</h2>\n<p>\nWe treat the provided coder-state export as a structured qualitative dataset.\nEach item node contains an excerpt and one or more citation anchors; each anchor’s <code>title</code> attribute provides a short evidence snippet.\nOur synthesis method follows five steps:\n(1) traverse the 1999–2009 node tree and collect all included excerpts and their anchors;\n(2) recluster excerpts into the paper’s mandatory outline (legal thresholds, attribution constraints, actor models, and solution proposals);\n(3) draft a cohesive narrative that prefers in-period terminology (“information warfare,” CNA, computer network operations) and avoids anachronistic framings;\n(4) enforce anchor-based verification so that every sentence containing a citation anchor is a faithful paraphrase of that anchor’s evidence snippet;\nand (5) deduplicate anchors within each paragraph when the same underlying citation is repeated.\n</p>\n<p>\nReproducibility is supported by the fact that all claims tied to citations are auditable: the reader can compare each cited sentence to the anchor <code>title</code> evidence snippet.\n</p>\n\n<h2>5. Experimental Setup / Data / Evaluation</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>Corpus.</strong>\nWithin the 1999–2009 folder, the dataset contains 107 coded item excerpts organised under 10 top-level thematic folders.\nAcross these excerpts, we observe 325 citation anchors pointing to 193 distinct quoted snippets, spanning 14 unique cited works (years: 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inclusion and exclusion.</strong>\nOnly material within the 1999–2009 folder is used for the paper narrative.\nContent outside this period remains in the coder-state file but is quarantined from the paper’s argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Evaluation criteria.</strong>\nWe evaluate internal validity by (i) anchor-title fidelity (every cited sentence matches its anchor’s evidence snippet) and (ii) citation hygiene (no redundant repetition of the same citation within a paragraph).\nBecause this is a historical-method paper, “performance” is assessed as traceability and argumentative coherence rather than predictive accuracy.\n</p>\n\n<h2>6.

Discussion</h2>\n<p>\nThe 1999–2009 attribution discourse can be read as an attempt to reconcile three pressures.\nFirst, self-defence and countermeasure logics were widely treated as actor-linked: the legitimacy of responsive action was argued to depend on identifying a responsible party and, often, a state nexus.\nSecond, technical realities were described as adversarial: routing through intermediaries, compromised servers, and deception meant that attribution was contestable and time-consuming.\nThird, institutional proposals confronted sovereignty, secrecy, and intrusiveness barriers: cooperation and verification were advanced as necessary, yet simultaneously described as difficult to implement.\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo families of solutions illustrate this tension.\nOne family sought to make strict attribution feasible through cooperation channels (mutual legal assistance, extradition, and trace-back assistance), sometimes with verification analogies.\nA second family sought to manage uncertainty by adjusting rules: narrowing which interests justify force (critical infrastructure lists), clarifying rules of engagement, or affording legal protection for good-faith responses when attribution and intent cannot be established quickly.\nHoisington argues that cyberwarfare technology makes it nearly impossible to attribute attacks to a specific source or to characterise intent behind them <a data-key=\"46FU3KYI\" data-orig-href=\"46FU3KYI\" data-quote-id=\"1b7e565052\" href=\"dq://1b7e565052\" title=\"the technology inherent in cyberwarfare makes it nearly impossible to attribute the attack to a specific source or to characterize the intent behind it\"><span style=\" font-family:'Inter','Segoe UI','Roboto','Arial','sans-serif'; text-decoration: underline; color:#60a5fa; background-color:transparent;\">(Hoisington, 2009, p. 15)</span></a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nJensen notes that active responses may include in-kind rejoinders or “hack-back” features that reflect similar damage back to the sender or otherwise respond <a data-dqid=\"de455d5678\" data-key=\"FLF7MXN7\" href=\"FLF7MXN7\" title=\"active responses may involve some in-kind rejoinder or &quot;hack-back&quot; feature, either reflecting similar damage back to the sender or causing some other responsive action\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: color(srgb 0.764706 0.837647 0.968627); text-decoration: underline; font-family: &quot;Space Grotesk&quot;, Inter, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, system-ui, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: color(srgb 0.0588235 0.0784314 0.105882 / 0.82);\">(Jensen, 2002, p. 26)</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>8. Limitations</h2>\n<p>\nThis paper is limited to the corpus represented in the provided coder-state export’s 1999–2009 folder; it does not claim comprehensive coverage of all publications in the decade.\nThe synthesis relies on anchor-title evidence snippets, which are necessarily short and may omit surrounding nuance in the underlying sources.\nBecause the objective is historical reconstruction of discourse, the analysis evaluates traceability and coherence rather than the empirical accuracy of any particular doctrinal prediction.\n</p>\n\n<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\nFrom 1999 to 2009, attribution was repeatedly portrayed as both gateway and bottleneck: gateway because lawful force and countermeasures were argued to depend on identifying a responsible actor, and bottleneck because technical and evidentiary constraints made such identification slow, contestable, and politically risky.\nThe decade’s literature linked these constraints to proposals centred on cooperation and procedure—mutual legal assistance, extradition, and verification analogies—while warning that sovereignty and intrusiveness would limit implementation.\nIt also produced rule-design proposals to manage uncertainty (critical infrastructure lists, rules of engagement, and good-faith response protections).\nOverall, the period’s discourse framed attribution as a socio-technical governance problem in which evidentiary thresholds, institutional channels, and escalation risk are inseparable.\n</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Condron (2007).

As discussed briefly in the introduction, the 90s experienced a singular surge of cyber incidents, which were not per se cyberattacks, but result of experiments of computer scientist/students. The surge was on flood attacks, creating of botnets and the beginning of Deny of service along with its techniques to counter theme. However, these types of incidents reached its apex in 2001 with Iloveyou bug representing effects of cyber incidents could reach the entire globe.The expansion of cyberspace was become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions.</p><p>It was in this dominant technical background that the literature of international relations start to think about cyber incidents. (Schmitt 1999) was pioneer in highlighting the fundamental question around cyber operations and law, but the emerging preoccupation with cyber operations lost track after 9/11. That explains why in our dataset, there is this hiatus in cyber conflict literature discussing cyber attribution. Only after the attacks on Estonia in 2007, studies regain attention with an increase of 70%. This first phase of studies, succeeded in bringing to attention two concerns a threshold question rooted in the UN Charter: can a cyber operation ever amount to an “armed attack” that justifies self-defence? Secondly, how to respond to cyber threads effectively?Debate:</p><p>The backdrop of the debate was the integration of technology into the government, business and individuals as well as the augment of attacks emergence. Particularly, although the 2007 was the wake up and most accurate representation of fears of this decade, the disruption, data theft, inoperability of services and for example power plants, water planters and so on were a preoccupation of scholars at the point where in 1999, Aquila wrote “cyber war is coming”. It was not rare comparisons with such as “cyber harbours” as almost III world war. As a result, must of the debate was legal language translatability. In case of a cyber-attack, how to define an attack, aggression, an armed attack? depriving the adversary of infrastructure that supports military operations such as electrical or communication systems (Hollis 2007, 125)</p><p>Across the lenses, then, attribution is alternately deferred (effects), discounted at the threshold (target/CNI), or streamlined to knowledge/acquiescence (instrument), while the baseline Charter view remains that force law applies “to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” (Condron, 2007, p. 413 :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}).To navigate this problem, early authors proposed three analytic lenses for evaluating cyber-attacks—each lens placed attribution in a different light. One approach was effects-based, judging cyber operations by their consequences rather than by the weapon or target. Following this view, if a computer network attack causes damage comparable to a conventional military strike, it should be treated as a use of force regardless of the tool used or the attacker’s intent. Schmitt (1999) articulated this consequences-centric test, suggesting that even a non-kinetic cyber operation qualifies as a prohibited use of force if its effects parallel those of a physical attack. A second, target-based approach prioritized the object of the cyber assault, especially if it struck critical national infrastructure. Proponents argued that penetrating systems vital to public welfare or national security inherently escalates the situation, perhaps warranting an immediate defensive response before full attribution is confirmed. In a notable early example, Jensen (2002) contended that international law should create a “safe harbor” for states to take prompt defensive action against attacks on critical infrastructure **without first attributing and characterizing the attack**, since waiting for certainty could be fatal. He even suggested that states publish a list of critical assets to put others on notice and bolster the legitimacy of reacting to attacks on those assets. The third approach was instrument-based, focusing on the means and methods of cyber attack. This perspective sought to define what counts as a cyber “weapon” or offensive act in advance, akin to how criminal law defines offenses, so that any use of such means might automatically be deemed hostile. For instance, Todd (2009) argued that we should identify and outlaw malicious cyber tools and techniques themselves, thereby simplifying attribution and legal classification: if a state deploys a recognized cyber weapon, that action can be labeled an attack without first measuring its outcome. Each model—effects, target, and instrument—handled attribution differently. The effects-based test could sidestep knowing the perpetrator’s identity by focusing on impact (though ultimately one must still find who caused the impact for accountability). The target-based test reduced the burden on attribution by justifying defensive moves when certain protected assets came under fire, effectively shifting the risk to the attacker if they chose those targets. The instrument-based approach tried to make attribution more straightforward by outlawing certain cyber techniques altogether; if those were detected in use, one could immediately attribute unlawful intent to whoever launched them. While none of these frameworks resolved the attribution challenge outright, they provided early conceptual tools for judging cyber operations under international law.</p><p>A key tension throughout this decade was the trade-off between action and certainty: should states wait for clear attribution and evidence before responding, or adapt the law to allow instantaneous defense in the face of ambiguous cyber threats? This debate often broke along the lines of “restraint” versus “urgency.” The restraint camp held that no matter how fast cyber attacks unfold, the traditional principles of necessity and proportionality – and the requirement of a definite armed attack – must govern. Scholars in this vein warned against lowering the evidentiary bar for self-defense, lest states too readily resort to force based on misidentification or fear. As one leading voice, Dinstein (2002) allowed for “interceptive” self-defense (striking an attack in progress) but only when an armed attack is clearly imminent or underway – essentially when the facts leave no doubt (“the die is cast”). He emphasized that even then, responses must be controlled by proportionality and aimed at halting or repelling the attack, not punishing the unknown perpetrator. This cautious stance implicitly required solid attribution: you must know an attack is coming or has happened, and who is responsible, before you hit back. On the other side, the urgency camp argued that cyber incursions move at network speed, potentially crippling critical systems in minutes, so insisting on ironclad attribution and state-level intent before reacting is unrealistic and dangerous. Jensen, for example, noted that a state under massive cyber assault on its power grid or financial system cannot afford to spend weeks tracing the attack while its infrastructure fails. He urged that a victim state acting in good-faith defense – using carefully calibrated countermeasures and targeting only the attacking code or server – should not be deemed in violation of international law even if it cannot yet prove who attacked it. Jensen (2002) argued that state survival might depend on “an immediate, robust, and aggressive response” and thus proposed a legal safe harbor for prompt cyber counter-attacks launched without full attribution. This viewpoint also acknowledged practical reality: often a state’s technical experts can identify that an attack is underway and even take action to block it (for example, by severing connections or disabling malicious servers) long before they can be certain who orchestrated it. The risk, of course, is that acting on partial information could hit an innocent intermediary or misidentify the source – a risk the restraint camp highlighted by pointing to the complex path of internet traffic. In essence, by the end of the 2000s the scholarly community had framed a dilemma: insisting on attribution and certainty keeps responses lawful but may leave a victim state “waiting helplessly” during a crippling cyber onslaught, whereas loosening those requirements empowers defense but runs afoul of sovereignty and legal stability if mistakes are made. This dilemma set the stage for many proposals to refine how attribution is handled in cyber law.</p><p>It was also in this moment the scaffold legal framework for cyberspace were created. The US act, convention of cybercrime budabest, European union directive</p><p>the main debate of this timeframe is concerning first legal reforms concerning the responses for cyberattacks. the decade was marked by acute fears of cyber war and the investigation in what pathways could be traced in terms of legal and policy responses. for the legal perspetictive the main debate was in doctrinal response: how can a state respond to cyberattacks triggering self-defense. for that specific response, we had questions how to define an armed attack  and how to attribute because without a doctrinal frame that the cyberattack mounted to armed attack and attribution, legal responses are fragile and authors pointed with high risks of escalation. s</p></div><div class='coder-children'><section class='coder-item' data-coder-type='item' data-coder-id='1c062b41789540a58d18d8e3e2749850'><p><a name=\"p6\"></a><span style=\" font-family:'Inter','Segoe UI','Roboto','Arial','sans-serif'; color:#d1d5db; background-color:transparent;\">L</span><span style=\" font-family:'Inter','Segoe UI','Roboto','Arial','sans-serif'; color:#d1d5db; background-color:transparent;\">egal commentators converge on a strong regularity: established jus ad bellum requirements—necessity, imminence, and proportionality—implicitly require reliable attribution before a state can lawfully employ force, and cyber operations routinely fail to produce that degree of proof.

As discussed briefly in the introduction, the 90s experienced a singular surge of cyber incidents, which were not per se cyberattacks, but result of experiments of computer scientist/students. The surge was on flood attacks, creating of botnets and the beginning of Deny of service along with its techniques to counter theme. However, these types of incidents reached its apex in 2001 with Iloveyou bug representing effects of cyber incidents could reach the entire globe.The expansion of cyberspace was become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. \n It was in this dominant technical background that the literature of international relations start to think about cyber incidents. (Schmitt 1999) was pioneer in highlighting the fundamental question around cyber operations and law, but the emerging preoccupation with cyber operations lost track after 9/11. That explains why in our dataset, there is this hiatus in cyber conflict literature discussing cyber attribution. Only after the attacks on Estonia in 2007, studies regain attention with an increase of 70%. This first phase of studies, succeeded in bringing to attention two concerns a threshold question rooted in the UN Charter: can a cyber operation ever amount to an “armed attack” that justifies self-defence? Secondly, how to respond to cyber threads effectively?Debate:\n\nThe backdrop of the debate was the integration of technology into the government, business and individuals as well as the augment of attacks emergence. Particularly, although the 2007 was the wake up and most accurate representation of fears of this decade, the disruption, data theft, inoperability of services and for example power plants, water planters and so on were a preoccupation of scholars at the point where in 1999, Aquila wrote “cyber war is coming”. It was not rare comparisons with such as “cyber harbours” as almost III world war. As a result, must of the debate was legal language translatability. In case of a cyber-attack, how to define an attack, aggression, an armed attack? depriving the adversary of infrastructure that supports military operations such as electrical or communication systems (Hollis 2007, 125)\nAcross the lenses, then, attribution is alternately deferred (effects), discounted at the threshold (target/CNI), or streamlined to knowledge/acquiescence (instrument), while the baseline Charter view remains that force law applies “to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” (Condron, 2007, p. 413 :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}).To navigate this problem, early authors proposed three analytic lenses for evaluating cyber-attacks—each lens placed attribution in a different light. One approach was effects-based, judging cyber operations by their consequences rather than by the weapon or target. Following this view, if a computer network attack causes damage comparable to a conventional military strike, it should be treated as a use of force regardless of the tool used or the attacker’s intent. Schmitt (1999) articulated this consequences-centric test, suggesting that even a non-kinetic cyber operation qualifies as a prohibited use of force if its effects parallel those of a physical attack. A second, target-based approach prioritized the object of the cyber assault, especially if it struck critical national infrastructure. Proponents argued that penetrating systems vital to public welfare or national security inherently escalates the situation, perhaps warranting an immediate defensive response before full attribution is confirmed. In a notable early example, Jensen (2002) contended that international law should create a “safe harbor” for states to take prompt defensive action against attacks on critical infrastructure **without first attributing and characterizing the attack**, since waiting for certainty could be fatal. He even suggested that states publish a list of critical assets to put others on notice and bolster the legitimacy of reacting to attacks on those assets. The third approach was instrument-based, focusing on the means and methods of cyber attack. This perspective sought to define what counts as a cyber “weapon” or offensive act in advance, akin to how criminal law defines offenses, so that any use of such means might automatically be deemed hostile. For instance, Todd (2009) argued that we should identify and outlaw malicious cyber tools and techniques themselves, thereby simplifying attribution and legal classification: if a state deploys a recognized cyber weapon, that action can be labeled an attack without first measuring its outcome. Each model—effects, target, and instrument—handled attribution differently. The effects-based test could sidestep knowing the perpetrator’s identity by focusing on impact (though ultimately one must still find who caused the impact for accountability). The target-based test reduced the burden on attribution by justifying defensive moves when certain protected assets came under fire, effectively shifting the risk to the attacker if they chose those targets. The instrument-based approach tried to make attribution more straightforward by outlawing certain cyber techniques altogether; if those were detected in use, one could immediately attribute unlawful intent to whoever launched them. While none of these frameworks resolved the attribution challenge outright, they provided early conceptual tools for judging cyber operations under international law.\nA key tension throughout this decade was the trade-off between action and certainty: should states wait for clear attribution and evidence before responding, or adapt the law to allow instantaneous defense in the face of ambiguous cyber threats? This debate often broke along the lines of “restraint” versus “urgency.” The restraint camp held that no matter how fast cyber attacks unfold, the traditional principles of necessity and proportionality – and the requirement of a definite armed attack – must govern. Scholars in this vein warned against lowering the evidentiary bar for self-defense, lest states too readily resort to force based on misidentification or fear. As one leading voice, Dinstein (2002) allowed for “interceptive” self-defense (striking an attack in progress) but only when an armed attack is clearly imminent or underway – essentially when the facts leave no doubt (“the die is cast”). He emphasized that even then, responses must be controlled by proportionality and aimed at halting or repelling the attack, not punishing the unknown perpetrator. This cautious stance implicitly required solid attribution: you must know an attack is coming or has happened, and who is responsible, before you hit back. On the other side, the urgency camp argued that cyber incursions move at network speed, potentially crippling critical systems in minutes, so insisting on ironclad attribution and state-level intent before reacting is unrealistic and dangerous. Jensen, for example, noted that a state under massive cyber assault on its power grid or financial system cannot afford to spend weeks tracing the attack while its infrastructure fails. He urged that a victim state acting in good-faith defense – using carefully calibrated countermeasures and targeting only the attacking code or server – should not be deemed in violation of international law even if it cannot yet prove who attacked it. Jensen (2002) argued that state survival might depend on “an immediate, robust, and aggressive response” and thus proposed a legal safe harbor for prompt cyber counter-attacks launched without full attribution. This viewpoint also acknowledged practical reality: often a state’s technical experts can identify that an attack is underway and even take action to block it (for example, by severing connections or disabling malicious servers) long before they can be certain who orchestrated it. The risk, of course, is that acting on partial information could hit an innocent intermediary or misidentify the source – a risk the restraint camp highlighted by pointing to the complex path of internet traffic. In essence, by the end of the 2000s the scholarly community had framed a dilemma: insisting on attribution and certainty keeps responses lawful but may leave a victim state “waiting helplessly” during a crippling cyber onslaught, whereas loosening those requirements empowers defense but runs afoul of sovereignty and legal stability if mistakes are made.

As discussed briefly in the introduction, the 90s experienced a singular surge of cyber incidents, which were not per se cyberattacks, but result of experiments of computer scientist/students. The surge was on flood attacks, creating of botnets and the beginning of Deny of service along with its techniques to counter theme. However, these types of incidents reached its apex in 2001 with Iloveyou bug representing effects of cyber incidents could reach the entire globe.The expansion of cyberspace was become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions.</p><p>It was in this dominant technical background that the literature of international relations start to think about cyber incidents. (Schmitt 1999) was pioneer in highlighting the fundamental question around cyber operations and law, but the emerging preoccupation with cyber operations lost track after 9/11. That explains why in our dataset, there is this hiatus in cyber conflict literature discussing cyber attribution. Only after the attacks on Estonia in 2007, studies regain attention with an increase of 70%. This first phase of studies, succeeded in bringing to attention two concerns a threshold question rooted in the UN Charter: can a cyber operation ever amount to an “armed attack” that justifies self-defence? Secondly, how to respond to cyber threads effectively?Debate:</p><p>The backdrop of the debate was the integration of technology into the government, business and individuals as well as the augment of attacks emergence. Particularly, although the 2007 was the wake up and most accurate representation of fears of this decade, the disruption, data theft, inoperability of services and for example power plants, water planters and so on were a preoccupation of scholars at the point where in 1999, Aquila wrote “cyber war is coming”. It was not rare comparisons with such as “cyber harbours” as almost III world war. As a result, must of the debate was legal language translatability. In case of a cyber-attack, how to define an attack, aggression, an armed attack? depriving the adversary of infrastructure that supports military operations such as electrical or communication systems (Hollis 2007, 125)</p><p>Across the lenses, then, attribution is alternately deferred (effects), discounted at the threshold (target/CNI), or streamlined to knowledge/acquiescence (instrument), while the baseline Charter view remains that force law applies “to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.” (Condron, 2007, p. 413 :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}).To navigate this problem, early authors proposed three analytic lenses for evaluating cyber-attacks—each lens placed attribution in a different light. One approach was effects-based, judging cyber operations by their consequences rather than by the weapon or target. Following this view, if a computer network attack causes damage comparable to a conventional military strike, it should be treated as a use of force regardless of the tool used or the attacker’s intent. Schmitt (1999) articulated this consequences-centric test, suggesting that even a non-kinetic cyber operation qualifies as a prohibited use of force if its effects parallel those of a physical attack. A second, target-based approach prioritized the object of the cyber assault, especially if it struck critical national infrastructure. Proponents argued that penetrating systems vital to public welfare or national security inherently escalates the situation, perhaps warranting an immediate defensive response before full attribution is confirmed. In a notable early example, Jensen (2002) contended that international law should create a “safe harbor” for states to take prompt defensive action against attacks on critical infrastructure **without first attributing and characterizing the attack**, since waiting for certainty could be fatal. He even suggested that states publish a list of critical assets to put others on notice and bolster the legitimacy of reacting to attacks on those assets. The third approach was instrument-based, focusing on the means and methods of cyber attack. This perspective sought to define what counts as a cyber “weapon” or offensive act in advance, akin to how criminal law defines offenses, so that any use of such means might automatically be deemed hostile. For instance, Todd (2009) argued that we should identify and outlaw malicious cyber tools and techniques themselves, thereby simplifying attribution and legal classification: if a state deploys a recognized cyber weapon, that action can be labeled an attack without first measuring its outcome. Each model—effects, target, and instrument—handled attribution differently. The effects-based test could sidestep knowing the perpetrator’s identity by focusing on impact (though ultimately one must still find who caused the impact for accountability). The target-based test reduced the burden on attribution by justifying defensive moves when certain protected assets came under fire, effectively shifting the risk to the attacker if they chose those targets. The instrument-based approach tried to make attribution more straightforward by outlawing certain cyber techniques altogether; if those were detected in use, one could immediately attribute unlawful intent to whoever launched them. While none of these frameworks resolved the attribution challenge outright, they provided early conceptual tools for judging cyber operations under international law.</p><p>A key tension throughout this decade was the trade-off between action and certainty: should states wait for clear attribution and evidence before responding, or adapt the law to allow instantaneous defense in the face of ambiguous cyber threats? This debate often broke along the lines of “restraint” versus “urgency.” The restraint camp held that no matter how fast cyber attacks unfold, the traditional principles of necessity and proportionality – and the requirement of a definite armed attack – must govern. Scholars in this vein warned against lowering the evidentiary bar for self-defense, lest states too readily resort to force based on misidentification or fear. As one leading voice, Dinstein (2002) allowed for “interceptive” self-defense (striking an attack in progress) but only when an armed attack is clearly imminent or underway – essentially when the facts leave no doubt (“the die is cast”). He emphasized that even then, responses must be controlled by proportionality and aimed at halting or repelling the attack, not punishing the unknown perpetrator. This cautious stance implicitly required solid attribution: you must know an attack is coming or has happened, and who is responsible, before you hit back. On the other side, the urgency camp argued that cyber incursions move at network speed, potentially crippling critical systems in minutes, so insisting on ironclad attribution and state-level intent before reacting is unrealistic and dangerous. Jensen, for example, noted that a state under massive cyber assault on its power grid or financial system cannot afford to spend weeks tracing the attack while its infrastructure fails. He urged that a victim state acting in good-faith defense – using carefully calibrated countermeasures and targeting only the attacking code or server – should not be deemed in violation of international law even if it cannot yet prove who attacked it. Jensen (2002) argued that state survival might depend on “an immediate, robust, and aggressive response” and thus proposed a legal safe harbor for prompt cyber counter-attacks launched without full attribution. This viewpoint also acknowledged practical reality: often a state’s technical experts can identify that an attack is underway and even take action to block it (for example, by severing connections or disabling malicious servers) long before they can be certain who orchestrated it. The risk, of course, is that acting on partial information could hit an innocent intermediary or misidentify the source – a risk the restraint camp highlighted by pointing to the complex path of internet traffic. In essence, by the end of the 2000s the scholarly community had framed a dilemma: insisting on attribution and certainty keeps responses lawful but may leave a victim state “waiting helplessly” during a crippling cyber onslaught, whereas loosening those requirements empowers defense but runs afoul of sovereignty and legal stability if mistakes are made.
