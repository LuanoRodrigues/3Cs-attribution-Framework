First, attribution is portrayed as a legal hinge: without it, remedies and defensive doctrines become hard to invoke in a disciplined way.\n    Second, the main debate of the period is whether law should retain strict attribution and evidentiary discipline (accepting delay and occasional remedial gaps) or instead relax and reallocate standards to enable timely defence (accepting higher mis‑attribution and escalation risk).\n    Third, proposed solutions are hybrid and incremental, reflecting scepticism that sweeping new multilateral instruments would appear quickly <a data-key=\"MFRGQXGQ\" data-dqid=\"f41be5172f\" href=\"MFRGQXGQ\" title=\"it seems extremely unlikely, however, that a multilateral convention restricting state action relating to information warfare will be adopted anytime soon\">(Johnson, 2002, p. 13)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The body of the paper is organised in three parts.\n    Section 1 reconstructs the core debate over thresholds—state responsibility and the jus ad bellum—under attribution uncertainty.\n    Section 2 analyses how attribution was portrayed in this period as a technical, jurisdictional, and evidentiary bundle, producing particular risks and incentives.\n    Section 3 maps the main remedy families proposed during the period (criminal‑law cooperation, omission/due‑diligence framings, and institutional capacity building) and the trade‑offs embedded in each.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>1. The central debate, 1999–2009: thresholds under uncertainty</h2>\n\n  <h3>1.1 Attribution as a precondition for state responsibility</h3>\n  <p>\n    A consistent move in the 1999–2009 literature is to frame responsibility analysis as a sequence.\n    Kulesza makes this explicit: to establish international responsibility for executing or ordering a cyber‑attack, one must first identify the international rule that the attack violates, and then attribute the action to a particular state <a data-key=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-quote-id=\"b475155321\" href=\"S4V5WX2Z\" title=\"consequently, in order to establish the international responsibility of a state for executing or ordering the execution of a cyber-attack it is necessary, as a first step, to show the international rule that such an attack violates. the second step of the analysis consists in attributing such an action to a particular state\">(Kulesza, 2009, p. 10)</a>.\n    The implication is straightforward but historically important: attribution is not just a fact to be discovered; it is the gateway condition that determines whether a response can be described as a lawful countermeasure, a claim of state responsibility, or a defensive use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The same period simultaneously underscores how cyberspace destabilises existing legal categories.\n    Dinstein notes that CNAs are not incorporated in any present list of proscribed weapons under lex lata <a data-key=\"9D6M6QKN\" data-quote-id=\"f675b7d615\" href=\"9D6M6QKN\" title=\"cnas are not incorporated in any present list of proscribed weapons under the lex lata\">(Dinstein, 2002, p. 16)</a>.\n    In practice, this compounds the attribution problem: uncertainty about what a cyber operation “counts as” can reinforce uncertainty about what a victim state is permitted to do in response.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>1.2 When cyber incidents approach armed‑attack thresholds</h3>\n  <p>\n    The debate becomes acute where effects could justify urgency.\n    Jensen offers an effects‑based scenario: a coordinated computer network attack that shuts down air traffic control, banking, and public utilities—while also opening floodgates and causing widespread civilian deaths—could be understood as an armed attack <a data-key=\"FLF7MXN7\" data-dqid=\"de092bae46\" href=\"FLF7MXN7\" title=\"i]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation&#x27;s air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no one would challenge the victim nation if it concluded that it was a victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack\">(Jensen, 2002, p. 21)</a>.\n    Schaap similarly reports an effects‑based approach associated with Schmitt: a cyber attack that has the potential to cause, or actually causes, physical damage, injury, or death would constitute a use of force or an armed attack <a data-key=\"KZLR9EC7\" data-quote-id=\"51633295cf\" href=\"KZLR9EC7\" title=\"using schmitt&#x27;s analysis a cyber attack that has the potential to cause, or actually causes, physical damage, injury, or death would constitute a use of force or an armed attack\">(Schaap, 2009, p. 23)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Yet the same literature stresses that urgency cannot erase evidentiary discipline.\n    Dinstein cautions that the victim must not act on “unfounded suspicions” and should not “rush headlong” into hasty action <a data-key=\"9D6M6QKN\" data-dqid=\"232ad4a15a\" href=\"9D6M6QKN\" title=\"state b must not rush headlong to hasty action predicated on reflexive impulses and unfounded suspicions; it has no choice but to withhold forcible response until hard evidence is collated and the state of affairs is clarified, lest the innocent be endangered\">(Dinstein, 2002, p. 13)</a>.\n    At the same time, he recognises an operational reality that pushes in the opposite direction: a state suffering a series of small‑scale attacks may respond to them aggregately in a single large‑scale forcible counter‑measure <a data-key=\"9D6M6QKN\" data-quote-id=\"e4ea625e40\" href=\"9D6M6QKN\" title=\"a state suffering from a series of small-scale attacks is permitted to respond to them aggregately in a single large-scale forcible counter-measure\">(Dinstein, 2002, p. 11)</a>.\n    This tension—between prudence and aggregation—captures the period’s central debate: whether attribution standards should remain strict even when attacks are distributed, fast, and plausibly deniable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Proportionality is treated as a doctrine that can discipline responses under uncertainty, but not by crude symmetry.\n    Doyle emphasises that proportionality in mission accomplishment is not a “comparison and symmetry” between the quantum of force and counterforce used <a data-key=\"SK4NF69N\" data-quote-id=\"5e6e978df8\" href=\"SK4NF69N\" title=\"proportionality in mission accomplishment, however, unlike self-defense, is not a comparison and symmetry between the quantum of force and counterforce used\">(Doyle, 2002, p. 10)</a>.\n    In the 1999–2009 corpus, proportionality analysis is therefore intertwined with attribution: the less certain the target and intent, the more consequential proportionality becomes—and the harder it is to apply convincingly.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>2. Patterns around attribution: challenges, risks, and incentives</h2>\n\n  <h3>2.1 Technical and operational challenges</h3>\n  <p>\n    The corpus treats technical attribution limits as structural.\n    Hollis notes that actors committing CNA can remain anonymous or disguise an attack’s origins to appear as if it comes from another identifiable source <a data-key=\"I2RU2RL3\" data-orig-href=\"I2RU2RL3\" data-quote-id=\"4324524712\" href=\"dq://4324524712\" title=\"the actor(s) committing cna can remain anonymous or even disguise an attack&#x27;s origins to appear as if it comes from some other identifiable source\">(Hollis, 2007, p. 10)</a>.\n    Dinstein adds the operational corollary: the apparently “source” server may have been manipulated by true assailants who routed their attack through it, and swift counter‑measures against the intermediary conduit are liable to be counterproductive and unlawful <a data-key=\"9D6M6QKN\" data-orig-href=\"9D6M6QKN\" data-quote-id=\"b51e7c86d3\" href=\"dq://b51e7c86d3\" title=\"frequently the server which is seemingly the source of the cna has only been manipulated by the true assailants (who have routed their attack through it), and swift responsive counter-measures against the intermediary conduit is liable to be counterproductive, as well as unlawful\">(Dinstein, 2002, p. 9)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A second constraint is the “human‑agent” gap.\n    Jensen states that no method exists to determine whether the individual behind an attack is a government agent <a data-key=\"FLF7MXN7\" data-orig-href=\"FLF7MXN7\" data-quote-id=\"0c1e11d343\" href=\"dq://0c1e11d343\" title=\"no method exists of determining whether the individual at the other end of the attack is a government agent\">(Jensen, 2002, p. 29)</a>.\n    Condron complements this by observing that even if an incident can be attributed to a specific computer system, it may not be possible to attribute it to the specific person coordinating the attack <a data-key=\"FL7BQXNA\" data-dqid=\"90836891fc\" href=\"FL7BQXNA\" title=\"while it may be possible to attribute an incident to a specific computer system, it may not be possible to attribute the incident to the specific person coordinating the attack\">(Condron, 2007, p. 16)</a>.\n    The temporal implication is explicit: investigations may take days or even months <a data-key=\"FL7BQXNA\" data-quote-id=\"9a170d974a\" href=\"FL7BQXNA\" title=\"it may take days or even months to investigate the attack\">(Condron, 2007, p. 17)</a>, producing a mismatch between instantaneous harm and delayed certainty.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>2.2 Jurisdiction and evidentiary geography</h3>\n  <p>\n    A persistent theme is that attribution is also constrained by jurisdictional fragmentation.\n    Condron’s claim that geographical borders are almost meaningless in cyberspace <a data-key=\"FL7BQXNA\" data-quote-id=\"ec41f2e632\" href=\"FL7BQXNA\" title=\"geographical borders are almost meaningless in cyberspace because cyberspace has no borders or boundaries in the traditional sense\">(Condron, 2007, p. 8)</a> parallels Johnson’s observation that geography has ceased to be relevant to the security of systems connected to the internet or accessible by radio <a data-key=\"MFRGQXGQ\" data-dqid=\"fd4c1bd567\" href=\"MFRGQXGQ\" title=\"- geography has ceased to be relevant to the security of information systems that are connected to the internet or that are accessible by radio\">(Johnson, 2002, p. 4)</a>.\n    In practical terms, evidence is dispersed and cooperation becomes part of the attribution process, not merely a diplomatic courtesy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The corpus is blunt about the downside of non‑cooperation.\n    Johnson argues that effective international cooperation in investigating computer offences has been frustrated by the unwillingness of the requested state to cooperate <a data-key=\"STRD2PML\" data-orig-href=\"STRD2PML\" data-quote-id=\"47870cb928\" href=\"dq://47870cb928\" title=\"effective international cooperation in investigating computer offenses has been frustrated by the unwillingness of the requested state to cooperate, its lack of domestic legal authority to investigate and punish computer offenses, the absence of established procedures and points of contact, and problems arising from extradition treaties\">(Johnson, 2002, p. 5)</a>.\n    The same author frames the potential upside: effective cooperation in tracing attacks to their origin would greatly expedite attribution of state‑sponsored CNA <a data-key=\"MFRGQXGQ\" data-orig-href=\"MFRGQXGQ\" data-quote-id=\"957426dae3\" href=\"dq://957426dae3\" title=\"effective international cooperation in tracing computer network attacks to their origin would also greatly expedite attribution of state-sponsored cna\">(Johnson, 2002, p. 7)</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>2.3 Risks, reluctance, and the attacker’s incentive structure</h3>\n  <p>\n    The 1999–2009 literature consistently links attribution uncertainty to escalation risk and strategic hesitation.\n    Schaap notes, in the Estonia‑related attacks, that there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned the attacks, although there was also no evidence that it tried to stop them either <a data-key=\"KZLR9EC7\" data-orig-href=\"KZLR9EC7\" data-quote-id=\"486dfc34b4\" href=\"dq://486dfc34b4\" title=\"there was no conclusive evidence that the russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either\">(Schaap, 2009, p. 27)</a>.\n    Kulesza’s account of April 2007 similarly depicts contested responsibility: Estonia blamed Russia for initiating and supporting the attacks, while Russian authorities described the operation as a civil initiative associated with a Kremlin‑supported youth organisation <a data-key=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-orig-href=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-quote-id=\"82269d7494\" href=\"dq://82269d7494\" title=\"in april 2007 the electronic infrastructure of estonia became the target of a synchronised attack by hackers, operating primarily from russian territory. estonia blamed russia for initiating and supporting those attacks...according to russian authorities, the attacks were a civil initiative; although coordinated by a youth organisation, supported by the kremlin, called &quot;nashi&quot; (&quot;ours&quot;), who claimed credit for the attack, stating however that it had no support from national authorities\">(Kulesza, 2009, p. 3)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Attribution difficulty is also portrayed as an attacker advantage.\n    Joyner notes that a foreign state could hire mercenary‑like individuals to carry out an IW attack without attribution to state sponsorship <a data-key=\"NAMDUAQB\" data-dqid=\"45fd6b806a\" href=\"NAMDUAQB\" title=\"or a foreign state could hire mercenary-like individuals to carry out an iw attack without attribution to state sponsorship\">(Joyner, 2001, p. 4)</a>,\n    and Smith suggests that the difficulty of attributing an information operation to its true source might give forces sufficient cover regarding the origin of the attack <a data-key=\"43D3RRWG\" data-orig-href=\"43D3RRWG\" data-quote-id=\"fce78f4b0d\" href=\"dq://fce78f4b0d\" title=\"the difficulty of attributing an information operation to its true source might give us forces sufficient cover regarding the origin of the attack\">(Smith, 2002, p. 13)</a>.\n    This “cover” dynamic helps explain a recurrent empirical posture in the corpus: public attribution is treated as a high‑risk act (politically and legally), while non‑attribution can be strategically stabilising even when it is normatively unsatisfying.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>3. Solutions and how they were framed in 1999–2009</h2>\n\n  <h3>3.1 Criminal‑law cooperation, and why it does not settle interstate attribution</h3>\n  <p>\n    One of the clearest patterns in the period is the asymmetry between criminal‑law progress and interstate legal clarity.\n    Kodar notes regional progress such as the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime and U.S. regulation of cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements, while stressing that these developments are mostly confined to domestic criminal law and do not address issues of international law <a data-key=\"STRD2PML\" data-quote-id=\"dac04f7b40\" href=\"STRD2PML\" title=\"there has been progress on a regional level - the council of europe has adopted the convention on cybercrime and the united states of america is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law\">(Kodar, 2009, p. 3)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kodar also describes why the gap persists: most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non‑state actors, but attribution to them—or to the state harbouring them—is complicated because evidence is hard to obtain and can be misleading in sophisticated attacks <a data-key=\"STRD2PML\" data-orig-href=\"STRD2PML\" data-quote-id=\"cb750c5ec0\" href=\"dq://cb750c5ec0\" title=\"most cnas are perpetrated by individuals and non-state actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the state harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack\">(Kodar, 2009, p. 10)</a>.\n    In parallel, Kodar states that international humanitarian law lacks explicit provisions dealing with CNA, IO, or cyber war <a data-key=\"STRD2PML\" data-orig-href=\"STRD2PML\" data-quote-id=\"9c02abca0b\" href=\"dq://9c02abca0b\" title=\"in international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either cna or io or cyber war\">(Kodar, 2009, p. 12)</a>.\n    The combined effect is a recurring 1999–2009 diagnosis: law enforcement may progress, but state‑to‑state remedies remain constrained by unresolved attribution standards.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>3.2 Doctrinal adaptation: omissions and due diligence</h3>\n  <p>\n    A distinctive late‑period move is to treat omissions as a way to bypass evidentiary bottlenecks about direct control.\n    Kulesza notes that doctrine and judicial interpretation support holding a state responsible not only for its actions but also for omissions, particularly failures to exercise due diligence <a data-key=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-quote-id=\"a3f57f3dfc\" href=\"S4V5WX2Z\" title=\"both the legal doctrine and judicial interpretation make clear that a state may be held responsible not only for its actions, but also for its omissions, in particular for the failure to exercise due diligence\">(Kulesza, 2009, p. 11)</a>.\n    She further argues that state responsibility should be based on due diligence rather than an obligation to show a formal link between state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators <a data-key=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-orig-href=\"S4V5WX2Z\" data-quote-id=\"d9c6614840\" href=\"dq://d9c6614840\" title=\"state responsibility must be based on a due diligence requirement rather than the obligation to show a formal link between the state authorities and the actions of actual perpetrators\">(Kulesza, 2009, p. 13)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Todd’s framing complements this approach by tying responsibility to cyberspace’s physical and temporal properties:\n    the speed and lack of physical borders are offered as key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory <a data-key=\"UT8F68NE\" data-dqid=\"da214d4b33\" href=\"UT8F68NE\" title=\"the unique attributes of cyberspace, such as its speed and lack of physical borders, are key reasons why host states must be responsible for actions within their territory when they do not take reasonable measures to stop the attack and warn the victim state\">(Todd, 2009, p. 26)</a>.\n    In 1999–2009 terms, this is the most systematic proposed “solution” to the core problem: when direct attribution is hard, reallocate duties to the territorial state to prevent, suppress, and assist in investigations.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>3.3 Institutionalisation: capacity, assistance, and cooperative tracing</h3>\n  <p>\n    The corpus also treats attribution as an institutional capacity problem.\n    Condron highlights that the U.S. Department of Defense did not have an organisation dedicated to and focused on cyber defence of critical infrastructure <a data-key=\"FL7BQXNA\" data-quote-id=\"4ebcf434cb\" href=\"FL7BQXNA\" title=\"the department of defense does not have an organization dedicated to and focused on the cyber defense of critical infrastructure\">(Condron, 2007, p. 10)</a>,\n    suggesting that attribution and defence require organisational design, not only better technical tools.\n    Hollis’s account of Estonia and Russia emphasises a related dimension: states can spar over duties to deny safe haven and obligations to assist in locating those responsible under mutual legal assistance arrangements <a data-key=\"I2RU2RL3\" data-orig-href=\"I2RU2RL3\" data-quote-id=\"1b215835f3\" href=\"dq://1b215835f3\" title=\"estonia and russia have sparred over questions of russia&#x27;s duty to deny a safe haven to the attackers and its obligation to assist estonia in locating those responsible under a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty\">(Hollis, 2007, p. 5)</a>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    By 2009, cooperative tracing proposals become more explicit.\n    Franzese suggests that the United States could reach agreements with other countries to recognise sovereignty in cyberspace, assist each other in tracing cyberattacks to their original sources, and identify the specific actors responsible <a data-key=\"MWF9EBHM\" data-dqid=\"63954b7e07\" href=\"MWF9EBHM\" title=\"multilaterally, the united states could reach agreements with other countries to recognize state sovereignty in cyberspace, to assist each other in tracing cyberattacks to their original sources, to identify the specific actors responsible for those cyberattacks, and to either prosecute or extradite those individuals responsible for the cyberattacks\">(Franzese, 2009, p. 42)</a>.\n    In historical terms, this is a shift from seeking certainty to building procedures that can support credible (though contestable) attribution over time.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>\n    The 1999–2009 attribution corpus is characterised by an unusually tight coupling between fact‑finding and legal authority.\n    Attribution is presented as the hinge that connects cyber incidents to state responsibility and to the jus ad bellum, while technical anonymity, deception, and investigative delay repeatedly undermine the speed and confidence needed for lawful response.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The main debate in the period can be stated plainly: keep strict attribution and evidentiary standards (accepting delay and occasional remedial gaps), or relax and reallocate standards (accepting more mis‑attribution and escalation risk).\n    The solution space that emerges by 2009 is hybrid rather than revolutionary: omission/due‑diligence framings, deeper cooperation for tracing and assistance, and institutional capacity building.\n    This is how attribution was portrayed in 1999–2009—less as a solvable technical problem and more as a permanent constraint that law and policy must design around.\n

Authors converge on institutional and procedural remedies (centralised capacity, multilateral tracing, doctrinal tests) but disagree sharply on the advisability and legal safety of anticipatory or active defenses; practical prospects for multilateral arms control appear weak. The literature implies that attribution alone rarely suffices: it must be paired with credible institutions, agreed procedures, and conservative proportionality rules to manage escalation.</span></section><section class='coder-item' data-coder-type='item' data-coder-id='960eba10-09f5-4d75-9df8-f4b42d605c68'><span style=\"color: rgb(232, 238, 245);

Scholars propose due‑diligence framing and notification mechanisms that convert political claims into legal “knowledge” and create obligations to act without full human attribution (Tsagourias, 2012, p. 14), explore shifting burdens via a rebuttable presumption (Chircop, 2018, p. 4), and underscore particular CBM designs to reduce escalation (al., 2014). The evidence shows these are complementary but contested paths rather than fully reconcilable solutions. Across the corpus there is a clear unresolved trade‑off: preserving high attribution standards protects against wrongful coercion but results in enforcement and remedial gaps; lowering thresholds or using effects‑based tests could improve recourse but risks mis‑attribution and escalatory error. Several authors stress the limits of adopting capability‑or effects‑based approaches absent robust procedural safeguards (Antonopoulos, 2015, p. 2), and others emphasize that deterrence strategies begin with attribution, thereby framing the political calculus states face when choosing between secrecy, public naming, or institutional remedies (Buchanan, 2014, p. 3). Technical scepticism about traceability thus trades enforcement efficacy against the heightened risk of diplomatic and kinetic mis‑steps (Ney, 2015, p. 7). Synthesis across paragraphs: the strongest regularities are that technical anonymity, routability through intermediaries, and evidentiary latency impose persistent attribution shortfalls that frustrate the person‑ and State‑focused premises of State‑responsibility law (Hobe, 2018, p. 12) and that doctrinal control tests are often empirically unattainable (Banks, 2017, p. 10).
