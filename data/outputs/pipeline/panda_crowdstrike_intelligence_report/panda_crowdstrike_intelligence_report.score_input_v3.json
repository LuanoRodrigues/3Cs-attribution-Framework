            "content": "# CrowdStrike to expose a previously undisclosed PLA unit involved in cyberespionage against Western technology companies. In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five Chinese nationals for economic espionage against U.S. corporations. The five known state actors are officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In response, the Chinese government stated that the claims were “absurd” and based on “fabricated facts”. China then went even further, stating “The Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cyber theft of trade secrets.” We believe that organizations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold China accountable until lasting change is achieved. Not only did the U.S. Government offer in its criminal indictment the foundation of evidence designed to prove China’s culpability in electronic espionage, but also illustrated that the charges are only the tip of a very large iceberg. Those reading the indictment should not conclude that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) hacking campaign is limited to five soldiers in one military unit, or that they solely target the United States government and corporations. Rather, China’s decade-long economic espionage campaign is massive and unrelenting. Through widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every part of the globe. At CrowdStrike, we see evidence of this activity first-hand as our services team conducts Incident Response investigations and responds to security breaches at some of the largest organizations around the world. We have first-hand insight into the billions of dollars of intellectual property systematically leaving many of the largest corporations - often times unbeknownst to their executives and boards of directors. The campaign that is the subject of this report further points to espionage activity outside of Unit 61398, and reveals the activities of Unit 61486. Unit 61486 is the 12th Bureau of the PLA’s 3rd General Staff Department (GSD) and is headquartered in Shanghai, China. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking this particular unit since 2012, under the codename PUTTER PANDA, and has documented activity dating back to 2007. The report identifies Chen Ping, aka cpyy, and the primary location of Unit 61486. This particular unit is believed to hack into victim companies throughout the world in order to steal corporate trade secrets, primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace and communication industries. With revenues totaling $189.2 billion in 2013, the satellite industry is a prime target for espionage campaigns that result in the theft of high-stakes intellectual property. While the gains from electronic theft are hard to quantify, stolen information undoubtedly results in an improved competitive edge, reduced research and development timetables, and insight into strategy and vulnerabilities of the targeted organization. Parts of the PUTTER PANDA toolset and tradecraft have been previously documented, both by CrowdStrike, and in open source, where they are referred to as the MSUpdater group"

This report contains details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PUTTER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. Our Global Intelligence Team actively tracks and reports on more than 70 espionage groups, approximately half of which operate out of China and are believed to be tied to the Chinese government. This report is part of our extensive intelligence library and was made available to our intelligence subscribers in April 2014, prior to the US Government’s criminal indictment and China’s subsequent refusal to engage in a constructive dialog. Targeted economic espionage campaigns compromise technological advantage, diminish global competition, and ultimately have no geographic borders. We believe the U.S. Government indictments and global acknowledgment and awareness are important steps in the right direction. In support of these efforts, we are making this report available to the public to _President/CEO & Co-Founder, CrowdStrike_"

The attribution provided in this report points to Chen Ping, aka cpyy (born on May 29, 1979), as an individual responsible for the domain registration for the Command and Control (C2) of PUTTER PANDA malware. In addition to cpyy, the report identifies the primary location of Unit 61486. PUTTER PANDA is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence-gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with specific targeting of the US Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. The PLA’s GSD Third Department is generally acknowledged to be China’s premier Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) collection and analysis agency, and the 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, supports China’s space surveillance network.

The report illuminates a wide set of tools in use by the actors, including several Remote Access Tools (RATs). The RATs are used by the PUTTER PANDA actors to conduct intelligence-gathering operations with a significant focus on the space technology sector. This toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the opportunity to deploy additional tools at will. They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. This report contains additional details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PUTTER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect themselves against this activity. **4** ###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team **KEY FINDINGS** ➔ \u0007Putter Panda is a cyber espionage actor that conducts operations from Shanghai, China, likely on behalf of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) 3rd General Staff Department 12th Bureau Unit 61486. This unit is supports the space based signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission. ➔ \u0007 The 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, is widely accepted to be China’s primary SIGINT collection and analysis agency, supporting China’s space surveillance network. ➔ \u0007 This is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligencegathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with specific targeting of space, aerospace, and communications. ➔ \u0007 The group has been operating since at least 2007 and has been observed heavily targeting the US Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. ➔ \u0007 They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks. ➔ \u0007 CrowdStrike identified Chen Ping, aka cpyy, a suspected member of the PLA responsible for procurement of the domains associated with operations conducted by Putter Panda. ➔ \u0007 There is infrastructure overlap with Comment Panda, and evidence of interaction between actors tied to both groups. **5** ###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team Attribution ###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team C2 Indicators Although some of the domains used for command and control of the tools described later in this report appear to be legitimate sites that have been compromised in some way, many of them appear to have been originally registered by the operators. Table 1 shows the domains that appear to have been registered by these actors, and the original email address used where known. **8** ###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team C2 Indicators (cont’d) The most significant finding is that an actor known as cpyy appears to have registered a significant number of C2 domains. This actor is discussed in the next section. Many of the domains have had their registrant information changed, likely in an attempt to obfuscate the identity of the operators"

The initial beacon uses a request with four parameters (h1, h2, h3, and h4) – as shown in Figure 8 – to register the implant with the C2 server. - Communication to and from the C2 server is obfuscated using a 1-byte XOR with the key 0xBE. - The commands supported by the RAT enable several capabilities, including: - Remote shell \u0007o Listing of running processes (including loaded modules) - Process termination (specified by PID) - File and directory listing - File upload, download, deletion, and timestamp modification **27**"

This sample contains a PDB path of Y:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\branch-downer\\ downer\\Release\\downer.pdb, but other similar paths Z:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\pngdowner\\Release\\ pngdowner.pdb and Z:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\downer\\Release\\downer.pdb have also been observed in other samples. Appendix 3 lists metadata for known pngdowner samples. Initially, the malware will perform a connectivity check to a hard-coded URL (http://www.microsoft.com), using a constant user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;). If this request fails, the malware will attempt to extract proxy details and credentials from Windows Protected Storage, and from the IE Credentials Store using publicly known methods [15], using the proxy credentials for subsequent requests if they enable outbound HTTP access. An initial request is then made to the hard-coded C2 server and initial URI – forming a URL of the form (in this sample) http://login.stream-media.net/files/xx11/index.asp?95027775, where the numerical parameter represents a random integer. A hard-coded user agent of myAgent is used for this request, and subsequent Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by communication with the C2 server. Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Twitter Account (names Content returned from this request to the C2 server will be saved to a file named index.dat in the user’s redacted) temporary directory (i.e., %TEMP%). This file is expected to contain a single line, specifying a URL and a filename. The malware will then attempt to download content from the specified URL to the filename within the user’s temporary directory, and then execute this file via the WinExec API. If this execution attempt succeeds, a final C2 request will be made – in this case to a URL using the same path as the initial request (and a similarly random parameter), but with a filename of success.asp. Content returned from this request will be saved to a file, but then immediately deleted. Finally, the malware will delete the content saved from the first request, and exit. redacted) The limited functionality, and lack of persistence of this tool, implies that it is used only as a simple downloadand-execute utility. Although the version mentioned here uses C++, along with Visual Studios Standard Template Library (STL), older versions of the RAT (such as MD5 hash b54e91c234ec0e739ce429f47a317313), built in 2011, use plain C. This suggests that despite the simple nature of the tool, the developers have made some attempts to modify and perhaps modernize the code. Both versions contain debugging/progress messages such as “down file success”. Although these are not displayed to the victim, they were likely used by the developers as a simple means to verify functionality of their code. **33**"

This malware also initially performs a connectivity check to www.microsoft.com using the hard-coded user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;), although in this variant no attempt is made to extract proxy credentials. The malware will then connect to its configured C2 infrastructure (file.anyoffice.info) and perform a HTTP request of the form shown in Figure 14 below: Content returned from the C2 server is deobfuscated by XOR’ing the content with a single byte, 0x12. The decoded data is then checked for the string runshell. If this string is not present, the C2 request is repeated every 0.5 seconds. Otherwise, a shell process is started (i.e., cmd.exe), with input/output redirected over the C2 channel. Shell commands from the server are followed by an encoded string $$$, which indicates that the shell session should continue. If the session is ended, two other commands are supported: m2b (upload file) and b2m (download file). Slight variations on the C2 URLs are used for different phases of the C2 interaction: - Shell command: /Microsoft/errorpost<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> - Shell response: /MicrosoftUpdate/GetUpdate/KB<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname> 15Both methods are detailed here: http://securityxploded.com/iepasswordsecrets.php **34**"

This dropper uses RC4 to decrypt an embedded payload from data in an embedded resource before writing the payload to disk and executing it. Several instances of this dropper have been observed, most commonly in association with the 4H RAT, but also in relation to other tools that will be described in forthcoming reporting. Another dropper has been observed, exclusively installing the pngdowner malware (example MD5 hash 4c50457c35e2033b3a03fcbb4adac7b7). This dropper is simplistic in nature, and is compiled from a single C++ source code file. It contains a Word document in plaintext (written to Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_Toulouse. doc), along with an executable (Update.exe) and DLL (McUpdate.dll). The executable and DLL are both contained within the .data section of the dropper, obfuscated with a 16-byte XOR key (consisting of the bytes 0xA0 – 0xAF). Screenshot of Truecaller Database Shared by DEADEYE JACKAL on Their Both the document and executable are written to disk and the executed via the ShellExecute API (using the Twitter Account (names verb “open”). The executable is also installed into the ASEP registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ redacted) CurrentVersion\\Run, with a value named McUpdate. Finally, the dropper deletes itself via a batch file. The dropped executable (MD5 hash 38a2a6782e1af29ca8cb691cf0d29a0d) primarily aims to inject the specified DLL (McUpdate.dll, MD5 hash 08c7b5501df060ccfc3aa5c8c41b452f) into a process that would normally be accessing the network, likely in order to disguise the malicious activity. Module names corresponding to Outlook Express (msinm.exe), Outlook (outlook.exe), Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe), and Firefox (firefox.exe) are used. If Internet Explorer is used, then the malware will attempt to terminate processes corresponding to two components of Sophos Anti-Virus (SAVAdminService.exe and SavService.exe). Four examples of these droppers were located, using a mixture of decoy PDF and Microsoft Word documents (shown below in Figures 15-18). The common theme throughout these documents is space technology (Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_Toulouse.doc does not follow this trend, but could be targeted at workers at the Toulouse Space Centre, the “largest space centre in Europe” ), indicating that the attackers have a keen interest in this sector, which is also reflected in the choice of name for some of the C2 domains used (see the Attribution section above). Twitter Account (names redacted) 16The API used expects a parameter of the form char**, and is given a char* pointer to the “*/*” string, but the stack data following this pointer is not properly zeroed or cleansed before use, leading to uncontrolled memory being read as other strings. **35**"
