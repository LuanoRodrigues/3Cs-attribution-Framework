<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-scope"><h2>Scope and Objective</h2><p>This methodology formalizes cyber-attribution assessment as a claim-based evidentiary scoring process. Each claim is scored on calibrated C-axes and then aggregated to document-level indicators under explicit weighting assumptions.</p><p>Execution mode: <code>aggregate</code>.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-pipeline"><h2>Pipeline and Data Lineage</h2><p>The pipeline executes deterministic stages: PDF to markdown, schema extraction, source inference, validation, scoring, and figure rendering. Each stage emits machine-readable artifacts for auditability.</p><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-data_model"><h2>Data Model: Claims, Sources, Artifacts, Evidence</h2><p>Claims provide legal assertions, sources provide provenance context and institutional identity, and artifacts provide technical exhibits. Evidence links claims to sources and artifacts through anchors.</p><h3>Source Classes</h3><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p><h3>Artifact Classes</h3><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-chain"><h2>Chain of Custody (C1)</h2><p>This axis is computed per claim and aggregated to the document level with reliability and shrinkage controls. The values below summarize the current scored output.</p><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-credibility"><h2>Credibility (C2, with Corroboration Subcomponent)</h2><p>This axis is computed per claim and aggregated to the document level with reliability and shrinkage controls. The values below summarize the current scored output.</p><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-clarity"><h2>Clarity (C3)</h2><p>This axis is computed per claim and aggregated to the document level with reliability and shrinkage controls. The values below summarize the current scored output.</p><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-aggregation"><h2>Claim-to-Document Aggregation</h2><p>This axis is computed per claim and aggregated to the document level with reliability and shrinkage controls. The values below summarize the current scored output.</p><p>No tabular data available for this section.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-portfolio"><h2>Portfolio Aggregation and Statistical Diagnostics</h2><p>Portfolio aggregation compares documents under the same scoring model and reports central tendency and dispersion diagnostics.</p><div class="wiki-table-wrap"><table class="wiki-table"><thead><tr><th>Document</th><th>Belief</th><th>Chain</th><th>Credibility</th><th>Clarity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units</td><td>0.13</td><td>52.58</td><td>0.1</td><td>51.74</td></tr><tr><td>APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units</td><td>0.08</td><td>40.65</td><td></td><td>42.34</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-validation"><h2>Validation Gates and Failure Semantics</h2><p>Validation checks schema conformance, anchor consistency, and grounding quality. FAIL denotes a quality gate failure, not necessarily runtime interruption. The pipeline can proceed in fail-soft mode to preserve diagnostic visibility.</p></section>
