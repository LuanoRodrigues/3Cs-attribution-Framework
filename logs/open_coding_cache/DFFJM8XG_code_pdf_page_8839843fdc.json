Possibly due to the long tradition of physical security, physical destruction is strongly emphasized. It is also easier to observe physical consequences. The old way of thinking is that a “severe cyber attack” has to involve physical destruction—people have to die and physical damage must be detected in critical infrastructure. However, as we become ever more dependent on data and non-kinetic assets, could, for example, the manipulation of health or financial records be treated with the same level of severity as physical consequences (Limnéll and Salonius-Pasternak 2016)? Moreover, is there a difference between banking data and healthcare data being manipulated, as the one can potentially lead to severe economic disruptions and the other in extremis to death? The answer is ambiguous. For example, NATO has stated that a major cyber attack could potentially trigger its mutual defense guarantee or Article 5. Yet it is unclear what “a major cyber attack” means in practice (Limnéll 2014). It has to be understood that the answer to the question “is a cyber attack an act of war?” is a political decision, not a conclusion. + ## Five Variables",
